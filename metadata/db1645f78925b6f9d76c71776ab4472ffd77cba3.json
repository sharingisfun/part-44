After a tune, Dave chats with Geno Bisconte, we get a Stringsy update, Geno roast battles Stevie, we see ESD on some Irish show, and Dave jerks off Bobo. Not kidding. Dave and Roy sing for us, Flutesy plays her mystery song, the audience interviews the guys, we hear some Osbourne impersonations, Dave pleads to Twitter, and damn, itâ€™s been a real fine day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1645f78925b6f9d76c71776ab4472ffd77cba3","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-07-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1645f78925b6f9d76c71776ab4472ffd77cba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,22,69,247,137,37,182,249,215,108,113,119,106,180,71,47,253,119,203,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
