The most obvious departure is the composer&amp;#039;s collaboration with lyricists/vocalists Eliza Gilkyson (on most tracks) and Carly Simon (on one). In keeping with this conversion to the song form, Vollenweider has added a new perkiness to his music, so it sounds less like Yanni and more like Kenny G.\n\n\nThe CD contains: \n\n1. Song Of Isolde \t\n2. Across The Iron River (The Return) \t\n3. Reason Enough (All The King&amp;#039;s Men) \n4. Eolian Minstrel \n5. Jaden Maiden \n6. The Secret Shrine Of Icarus \t\n7. Harvest \n8. The Years In The Forest \n9. Desert Of Rain \t\n10. Private Fires \t\n11. The Five Sisters \t\n12. Painter&amp;#039;s Waltz \t \n13. Leaves Of The Great Tree \t \n14. Lake Of Time \n\n\nAs usual everything is tagged, encoded with Ogg Vorbis aoTuV at Q8 and the cover is included. Ogg Vorbis is a format which can be played gaplessly just use the m3u file included to the release.\n\nEnjoy! \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c5a8bd6d3be6b1860dfd1fa86628c37afe6182","amp;dn":"Andreas+Vollenweider+-+Eolian+Minstrel+%5B1993%5D%5BOgg+Vorbis+Q8%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c5a8bd6d3be6b1860dfd1fa86628c37afe6182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,197,168,189,109,59,230,177,134,13,253,31,168,102,40,195,122,254,97,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
