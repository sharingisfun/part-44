One strange thing about this album is that it doesn&amp;#039;t present some of the cues in the order in which they appeared in the movie: the music for &quot;The Train&quot; sequence, in which Marty McFly and Doc Brown rig the time-traveling DeLorean up to a train in order to return to the 20th century, is scattered throughout the album instead of appearing together. Overall, though, that&amp;#039;s a minor quibble, as Silvestri&amp;#039;s music is still quite engaging, particularly his instrumental take on ZZ Top&amp;#039;s &quot;Doubleback.&quot;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Main Title - Alan Silvestri [3:05]\n02 - It&amp;#039;s Clara (The Train, Pt. 2) - Alan Silvestri [4:33]\n03 - Hill Valley - Alan Silvestri [2:20]\n04 - The Hanging - Alan Silvestri [1:40]\n05 - At First Sight - Alan Silvestri [3:12]\n06 - Indians - Alan Silvestri [1:10]\n07 - Goodbye Clara - Alan Silvestri [2:57]\n08 - Doc Returns - Alan Silvestri [2:50]\n09 - Point of No Return (The Train, Pt. 3) - Alan Silvestri [3:45]\n10 - The Future Isn&amp;#039;t Written - Alan Silvestri [3:35]\n11 - The Showdown - Alan Silvestri [1:28]\n12 - Doc to the Rescue - Alan Silvestri [0:51]\n13 - The Kiss - Alan Silvestri [1:51]\n14 - We&amp;#039;re Out of Gas - Alan Silvestri [1:15]\n15 - Wake up Juice - Alan Silvestri [1:11]\n16 - A Science Experiment?
