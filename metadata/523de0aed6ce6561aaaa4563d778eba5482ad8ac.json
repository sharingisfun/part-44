Tom Brown was taught the ancient skills of survival by a Native American he called Grandfather. His most advanced lessons were those of the scouts, members of a secret society who were highly attuned to nature. The scouts refined tracking to a disciplined science and art form. With these physical skills came enhanced perception and true enlightment. &quot;Tracking was their doorway to the universe,&quot; Tom Brown writes, &quot;where they could know all things through the tracks...&quot;Now Tom Brown, Jr. shares generations of wisdom through one of the most rewarding pursuits to be found in nature. Tracking lets us unlock the secrets of each animal we follow, and in turn, to become more aware of our own place in nature and the world. It is a journey of discovery that engages the senses, awakens the spirit, and enlightens the soul","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523de0aed6ce6561aaaa4563d778eba5482ad8ac","amp;dn":"Tom+Brown%27s+Science+and+Art+of+Tracking+%281999%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523de0aed6ce6561aaaa4563d778eba5482ad8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,61,224,174,214,206,101,97,170,170,69,99,215,120,235,165,72,42,216,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
