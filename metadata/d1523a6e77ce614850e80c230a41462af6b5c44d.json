Beneath Danika's buttoned-up exterior lives a woman with wild-side desires she has yet to fully discover.\nTattoo artist Paddy O'Shea walks on society's razor edge. When he learns his best friend, Cooper Hanes, has more than a casual interest in Danika, Paddy suggests a weekend celebration of exploration none of them will ever forget.\nFor the next forty-eight hours the men satisfy fantasies Dani didn't even know she had. But every party has to end. Doesn't it? Or can the courtroom diva turn Dani's Duo into something as permanent as one of Paddy's tattoos?\nGenre: Erotic Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1523a6e77ce614850e80c230a41462af6b5c44d","amp;dn":"Dani%27s+Duo+by++Lauren+Fraser.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1523a6e77ce614850e80c230a41462af6b5c44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,82,58,110,119,206,97,72,80,232,12,35,10,65,70,42,246,181,196,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
