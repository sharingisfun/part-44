A classically trained animator with credits in film (including storyboard artist on Coraline), television, and video games, Annable has for years spent his free time creating some of the funniest, most poignant comics anywhere. As befits his animation background, Annable's fluid art pulses with life, in stories that practically jump off the page. Alternately poetic and hilarious, Grickle presents a strange twist on the everyday with heart and humor. If you've experienced Grickle before, this is the greatest collection yet. If you haven't, there's no better introduction than Book of Grickle!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b44f62f0314f903da397ffd6fd7654575fb4dfa8","amp;dn":"Graham+Annable+-+The+Book+Of+Grickle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b44f62f0314f903da397ffd6fd7654575fb4dfa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,79,98,240,49,79,144,61,163,151,255,214,253,118,84,87,95,180,223,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
