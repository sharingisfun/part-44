The main highlight is the final song, Texas Flood, with Bonnie Raitt. She adds tasteful licks on the slide at all the right places. She's been a friend of SRV's since his days back in Austin before he even really got a following\nThey say it's a soundboard recording but it appears it may be an FM broadcast of a SB recording. Anyway, the quality is quite good.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Soul To Soul - 7:53 \n02. Look At Little Sister - 5:28 \n03. Ain't Gonna Give Up On Love - 7:42 \n04. Change It - 4:49 \n05.
