Showgirl. Entertainer. Exotic Dancer.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦fake tits, VIP rooms, rock stars, and bottles of Champagne, rap videos, lap dances, stacks of cash, expensive cars and sex, sex, sex.\nMaybe these are just a few of the images that are conjured up when you hear the phrase, STRIP CLUB. Beautiful, young women, who party every night, love sex, keep their tans even in winter, are physically fit, independent, cosmetically enhanced and open to anything. Sexual fantasies come to life; as if a living, breathing amateur porn starlet has stepped off the screen and onto your lap.\n\nAnd you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have her, can you? Spinning around the pole on the main stage of thousands of strip joints and gentlemen's clubs, is a woman, blatantly sexual and with an air of jaded sophistication. She is surrounded by flashing stage lights, pounding music and men desperate for attention; watched over by the club bouncers and thoroughly absorbed in getting paid. She is beyond you, unobtainable, untouchable. When confronted with a woman such as this, often the best you can do is mumble nonsensically about how hot she is or how incredible she dances as you awkwardly hand her some dollar bills. You can do better, and I will show you how.\n\nThis is some of what you'll learn: \n\nWhy everything you think about dancers is wrong.\nHow to seduce a stripper without hypnosis or lies.\nHow to make it about more than money.\nHow to date any exotic dancer.\nMeeting girls, attracting women and finding a girlfriend at strip clubs.\n\n\nThe real problem is that most men see exotic dancers as untamable sex objects that are only attracted to rock stars, rappers, and professional athletes or guys with money. Strippers are constantly surrounded by men demanding time, attention, and most of all, sex. Worse still, the stripper stereotype involves shitty education, promiscuity, poor relationship skills, dysfunctional families, marginal socialization and mental issues. The average guy's ideas about strippers make them seem low-class, undesirable for anything other than sex, and ultimately unobtainable without the involvement of other mitigating factors, like winning the lottery, driving a new Maserati or getting a dick implant.\n\nOf course, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all just bullshit.\n\nYou donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to read this book or listen to anything that I have to say about how to succeed when your goal is dating strippers. You can keep walking into strip clubs, hoping for the best. You can blow all your cash for the dubious pleasure of going home, as usual, empty handed. Better still, you can, all on your own, keep doing those things that will guarantee you never get the chance to date the woman that you actually want, ending up frustrated, broke and lonelyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but of course, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your choice.\n\nOrÃ¢â‚¬Â¦You can learn how to approach and attract the exotic dancer of your dreams, and stop fantasizing about her because you will actually be dating her for real.\n\nTHE STRIP CLUB DATING SURVIVAL GUIDE\nis the dating book for the single guy who wants to start picking up the women he meets at strip clubs, for the pickup artist who wants to know why his game isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t working with strippers, or for anyone who has ever been curious about strip joints and the crazy, sexy women that work in them.\n\nI have been dating strippers for nearly twenty years, and worked in the adult industry for nearly 15 years. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dated dancers, in real relationships and in that nightmare that dating a stripper can be when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing. You now have the opportunity to learn from my success and failure, and find the woman youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always waited for.\n\nYou can show her the way home, and THE STRIP CLUB DATING SURVIVAL GUIDE will show you how.\n\nThe Strip Club Dating Survival Guide is an inside look at America's strip joints, and the beautiful women that take it all off a few dollars at a time. Written by a club insider to help the average guy turn his stripper girlfriend fantasy into a reality. Learn all about strip clubs, the lives of exotic dancers and what will set you apart from the other customers. Find out how dancers think, act, what they want and the ways anyone can influence strippers to become vulnerable to romance. Learn how to handle money, impress the girls and keep your bank balance intact. Find out how, when and where to pursue a stripper, when to change targets, and what to look for, when you're getting it right or doing it wrong. Learn when to be persistent, and when to abandon the chase. If you want a woman who loves to dance, makes all your friends jealous, and brings other girls home to play with you, then The Strip Club Dating Survival Guide can show you the way.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nThe Strip Club Dating Survival Guide is the work of Jason Keeler (that's me)...stripper wrangler, adult webmaster, strip club operator, and writer of www.RawkMode.com, the adult industry blog site. I have worked in live adult entertainment for nearly 15 years, almost exclusively dating women working in and around strip clubs for two decades. \n\nI live with my son, Seth (who was totally not named after Sheriff Seth Bullock of &quot;Deadwood&quot; fame...probably) and occasionally with my partner and arch-nemesis Simone DanaLustrous, an award-winning exotic dancer and national touring feature entertainer. Simone may or may not...allegedly...be Seth's mom; but if that maternity test comes back negative...well, let's just say she's going to owe some damn rent money around this joint.\n\nI have a deep and abiding love for American history, science fiction, naked ladies and Disney movies (don't tell anyone about that last part though, thanks.) My favorite authors are Robert Heinlein, David Brin, Harry Turtledove, Jeff Shaara, Chuck Palahniuk, S.M. Stirling and Dan Abnett. I love Star Trek, learned everything I know about everything from watching Star Wars as a kid, and actively worry that George R.R. Martin might die before completing Game of Thrones. \n\nI'm a philosophical Libertarian (of the Heinlein side of the family, not the Rand side,) and once held elected office as a member of the Green Party for reasons that I am still definitely unclear on. As a demonstration of my commitment to preservering through my own bouts of self-inflicted idiocy, I somehow pulled off being a vegetarian while serving as a tank gunner during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nDespite being involved in a long-term open relationship, or perhaps because of it, I have been told I am emotionally unavailable and somewhat reclusive. Whether that is true or not, I'm fairly certain that my seeming aloofness has more to do with some deeply hurt feelings left over from direct contact with that final, totally obnoxious episode of Battlestar Galactica","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af84c2da64c63cf26023f2759021e20f7362bf90","amp;dn":"The+Strip+Club+Dating+Survival+Guide+%282012%29+Epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af84c2da64c63cf26023f2759021e20f7362bf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,132,194,218,100,198,60,242,96,35,242,117,144,33,226,15,115,98,191,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
