His straightforward approach allows listeners to feel the full force of ruthless politics with painful clarity. The beauty of BoatmanÃƒâ€¢s narration may well be his resistance to overplaying the storyÃƒâ€¢s drama as Grace takes on the most incendiary issues of our time--racism, terrorism, religious fundamentalism, and gay rights. Patterson and Boatman prove to be a pair of gifted storytellers.\n\nSen. Corey Grace is the most charismatic and compassionate conservative Republican to ever run for president. He believes in women&amp;#039;s choice, gay rights, gun control and stem cell research. Ordinarily, these would be suicidal platform points, but the other two candidates?a bombastic but honorable hard-line evangelist and a loutish Senate majority leader who is backed by a Machiavellian media giant?stand a good chance of splitting the far right vote. Patterson is best-known for his thrillers, but The Race is long on lore and shy on suspense. It&amp;#039;s also filled with all-too-familiar political events and characters that are almost parodies of people living or dead. Grace has several well-written speeches that Michael Boatman delivers with the wise and wry voice of reason. Boatman also captures the dramatic baritone of the evangelist; the smarmy and nasal senator; and the evil media baron who sounds a bit Australian. Boatman does a fair job of imitating the voices of real-life characters but saves his best mimicry for a rancorous radio pundit whom Patterson has given a fictional name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ce1683b69cc23b0bb5f9af53f51641ea68a679","amp;dn":"Richard+North+Patterson+-+The+Race+%2848k+.MP3+Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3ce1683b69cc23b0bb5f9af53f51641ea68a679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,206,22,131,182,156,194,59,11,181,249,175,83,245,22,65,234,104,166,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
