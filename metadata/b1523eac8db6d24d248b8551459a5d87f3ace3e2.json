Her ancestors played an important role in expediting Japan's emergence from its period of isolation, namely from the Edo era to the modern Meiji period in the mid-1800s. Being brought up in a strict family, the teenaged Umekichi was especially talented in classic ballet and piano. Late in her teens, she visited Tokyo and had a chance to see the Azuma Odori Concert, a huge once-a-year event hosted by the Tokyo geishas. This experience had a great impact on her life. She learned to play the shamisen (a three-stringed musical instrument played with a plectrum), enrolled in a state-operated academy of traditional Japanese music, and trained for two years. She then started her professional career as a house shamisen player in various rakugo theatres. In 2001, she made her debut as a &quot;pop artist with a Japanese coiffure&quot; and, ever since, has been widely recognized as a missionary to communicate the Edo culture and its music to a contemporary audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1523eac8db6d24d248b8551459a5d87f3ace3e2","amp;dn":"Umekichi+-+The+Voice+of+Geisha+Doll+%28japanese+traditional+music%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1523eac8db6d24d248b8551459a5d87f3ace3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,82,62,172,141,182,210,77,36,139,133,81,69,154,93,135,243,172,227,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
