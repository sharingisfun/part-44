Eleven bakers remain and this time their pastry        \n  skills are scrutinised as the bakers tackle tarts. Over two days the  \n  bakers will face three increasingly complicated challenges whilst     \n  trying to avoid a soggy bottom.                                       \n                                                                        \n  Judged by acclaimed master baker Paul Hollywood and legendary         \n  cookery writer and baker Mary Berry, the bakers start with a          \n  signature bake: a quiche that says something about them. Next is the  \n  dreaded technical challenge where they are faced with baking a        \n  classic tarte au citron. Finally, our bakers have to deliver in bulk  \n  as they are asked to deliver 24 show-stopping sweet miniature tarts.  \n                                                                        \n  The pressure of pastry proves too much for some.
