Since then, Chauveau has made a name for himself as a classical auteur with ever-growing ties to ambient and experimental idioms. The Black Book of Capitalism gives the listener a chance to encounter a musician still committed to melody and harmony over texture and atmosphere. Those familiar with the disquieting silence that pervades works like 2007Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s S. may be surprised to find how unabashedly orchestral much of this album is.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Le Marin RejetÃƒÂ© Par La MerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a traditional chamber piece with a wistful piano theme that endures the dual infiltration of a single male voice and violin that mirror each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melodies, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“DerniÃƒÂ¨re Ãƒâ€°tape Avant Le SilenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a mobile, uplifting hymn that sounds more like Beirut or Yann Tiersen than Satie or Stars of the Lid -- the latter two being artists whose work Chauveau has been more likely to reference in recent years. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dialogue Avec Le Vent,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as its title implies, could be likened to a weather vane, one that points alternately to ChauveauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical past and to the path that he would begin to trace after this recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release. A simple guitar figure persists amid an encroaching cloud of sustained guitar and horn tones. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty piece that suffers a bit from its split allegiance to post-rock and ambient music.\n\nThe real stunner here is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Je Suis Vivant et Vous ÃƒÅ tes Morts,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which consists of a relentless bomb-like ticking, swirling streams of distorted organ tone, and a few sharp intakes of breath, cut off before theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re finished. The ticking compounds to become an articulated, mechanical crank abutted by sexual cooing and shadowy columns of horn sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scary and seductive and leaves one unprepared for the sudden, larger-than-life arrival of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mon Royaume,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which sounds like the intro to a Def Jux release with its big, slappy drums, crackly, antiquated samples, and menacing synth tones. All of this bombast abruptly gives way to a piano piece deeply nostalgic for Satie.\n\nSuch abrupt transitions mean that The Black Book of Capitalism plays more like a label compilation than a solo album. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a testament to ChauveauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s versatility, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a detriment to the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overall quality, which ultimately moves in too many directions for the listener to remain fully engaged for its duration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b79f2b41c885a3d9d09d3d05b643a74f25685e","amp;dn":"Sylvain+Chauveau+-+The+Black+Book+Of+Capitalism+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Cc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b79f2b41c885a3d9d09d3d05b643a74f25685e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,183,159,43,65,200,133,163,217,208,157,61,5,182,67,167,79,37,104,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
