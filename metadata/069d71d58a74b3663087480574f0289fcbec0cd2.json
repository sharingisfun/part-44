The story of the Crusades is remembered as a tale of religious fanaticism and unspeakable violence, but now fresh research, eyewitness testimony, and contemporary evidence from both the Christian and Islamic worlds shed new light on how these two great religions waged war in the name of God.\n\nPart 2: The Clash of Titans\nIn the second episode of this three-part series, Dr Thomas Asbridge offers a piercing examination of the Third Crusade and the two renowned figures who have come to embody Crusader war: Richard the Lionheart, king of England, and the mighty Muslim sultan Saladin, unifier of Islam. Drawing on fascinating eyewitness accounts and contemporary records, Dr Asbridge constructs an insightful and nuanced picture of these men and their fiercely fought struggle for the Holy Land. Almost perfectly matched as adversaries, these two titans of holy war clashed during a year-long campaign that raged across Palestine. Both were willing to commit appalling atrocities in pursuit of victory. Each brought the full force of his military genius, guile and cunning to bear, all in pursuit of the ultimate prize: Jerusalem. Dr Asbridge reveals how this shattering conflict brought Saladin and Richard to their knees, even as it served to forge their legends.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1530 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime per Part 59.mins\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 701 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:069d71d58a74b3663087480574f0289fcbec0cd2","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Crusades.2of3.The.Clash.of.Titans.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"069d71d58a74b3663087480574f0289fcbec0cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,157,113,213,138,116,179,102,48,135,72,5,116,240,40,159,203,236,12,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
