He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and has been dubbed &quot;The Father of Modern Philosophy&quot; in recognition of the fact that much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings.\n\nThe DISCOURSE ON METHOD is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the evolution of natural sciences.  Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.  Together with MEDITATIONS ON FIRST PHILOSOPHY (Meditationes de Prima Philosophia), PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY (Principia philosophiae) and RULES FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE MIND (Regulae ad directionem ingenii), it forms the basis of the epistemology known as Cartesianism.\n\n\nThis collection includes all the principal philosophical works (in multiple translations), several anthologies, and a large selection of the essays and correspondence.
