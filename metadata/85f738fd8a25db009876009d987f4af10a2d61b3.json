The game has a minimal story, in which the player is told by letters of a mysterious box in a room in a house; as the player solves the puzzles around the box, more notes from the same author - one who previously had solved the mystery of the box - are found, describing the box's use of an ethereal material called &quot;Null&quot;, as well as showing the author slowly descending into madness.\n\nOn starting the game, the player is presented with the first of four puzzle boxes. The first box is offered as a tutorial to the game's controls, which demonstrate how to move around the box and interact with features of the box. The player has a small inventory for items like keys found in compartments in the box. A key inventory element is a special lens that, in-game, allows the player to see things made from the Null element that compose parts of the box. The lens can generally be equipped at any time to see these secrets, often requiring the player to manipulate the view to align secrets into a coherent symbol. The goal is to fully unlock each puzzle box, extracting a smaller but more complicated box within it.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f738fd8a25db009876009d987f4af10a2d61b3","amp;dn":"The+Room+%282014%29%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f738fd8a25db009876009d987f4af10a2d61b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,247,56,253,138,37,219,0,152,118,0,157,152,127,74,241,10,45,97,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
