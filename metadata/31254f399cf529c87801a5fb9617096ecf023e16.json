Written by an acclaimed author team, Kinetics in Nanoscale Materials is the first book to discuss simple but effective models of the systems and processes that have recently been discovered. The text, for researchers and graduate students, combines the novelty of nanoscale processes and systems with the transparency of mathematical models and generality of basic ideas relating to nanoscience and nanotechnology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31254f399cf529c87801a5fb9617096ecf023e16","amp;dn":"Kinetics+in+Nanoscale+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31254f399cf529c87801a5fb9617096ecf023e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,37,79,57,156,245,41,200,120,1,165,251,150,23,9,110,207,2,62,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
