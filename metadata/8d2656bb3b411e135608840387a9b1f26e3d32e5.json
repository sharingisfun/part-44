Down in the Delta captures the no-frills, down-in-the-alley, gutbucket, lowdown and lonesome deep blues of Oscher's live performances.\nPaul Oscher first came to national attention as Muddy Waters' harmonica player from 1967-1972 (following in the footsteps of Little Walter, Junior Wells, James Cotton and Big Walter Horton). The first white musician to become a full-time member of a world-class black blues band, Muddy treated Oscher like a son. Oscher shared the basement in Muddy's southside Chicago home with the great Otis Spann. Working alongside Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Sammy Lawhorn, Pee Wee Madison and S.P. Leary, Oscher learned deep Blues phrasing and timing. He learned to play slide guitar from Muddy--literally by looking over Muddy's shoulder--and piano from Otis Spann.\n&quot;I certainly draw from the time I was on the road with Muddy and the experiences I had living on the southside. I give thanks everyday for that--it's the biggest gift of my life and it's given me my foundation...&quot;\n\n\nTracklist\n1. Driftin' Blues 4:55\n2. St. Louis Blues 2:53\n3.
