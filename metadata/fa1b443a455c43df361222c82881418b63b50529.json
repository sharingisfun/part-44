Londinium is a smoky, dark, and dangerous place, home to mischievous metal fairies and fearsome clockwork dragons that breathe scalding steam. \n\nThe people wear goggles to protect their eyes, brass grill insets in their nostrils to filter air, or mechanical limbs to replace missing ones.\n\nOver it all rules the Lady, and the Lady has demanded a new sonÃ¢â‚¬â€a perfect flesh-and-blood child. She has chosen Jack.\n\nJackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonder at the magic and steam-powered marvels in Londinium lasts until he learns he is the pawn in a very dangerous game. The consequences are deadly, and his only hope of escape, of returning home, lies with a legendary clockwork bird. The Gearwing grants wishes. Or it did, before it was broken. Before it was killed.\n\nBut some things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay dead forever.\n\nGenre: Young Adult | Fantasy | Steampunk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa1b443a455c43df361222c82881418b63b50529","amp;dn":"Flights+and+Chimes+and+Mysterious+Times+by+Emma+Trevayne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa1b443a455c43df361222c82881418b63b50529","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,27,68,58,69,92,67,223,54,18,34,200,40,129,65,139,99,181,5,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
