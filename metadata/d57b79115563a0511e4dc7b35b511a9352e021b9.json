There have been various films about this subject, even a Hollywood production starring Catherine Deneuve and Omar Sharif as Rudolf, who is also part of this recent production as a painter and friend of Rudolf, but they all stressed the romantic subtext of the events and largely ignored the political and personal conflicts which made Rudolf do what he did. But this new film version of the story really does include quite a lot of Rudolf's personal and political background and in the end portrays him as one of the first to imagine an united and peaceful Europe, an idea his time and age wasn't yet ready for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57b79115563a0511e4dc7b35b511a9352e021b9","amp;dn":"%28The+Crown+Prince%29_aka_Kronprinz.Rudolf.2006.DVDRip.XviD-TheWret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57b79115563a0511e4dc7b35b511a9352e021b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,123,121,17,85,99,160,81,30,77,199,179,91,81,26,147,82,224,33,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
