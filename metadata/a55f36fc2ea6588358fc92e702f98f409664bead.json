They are best known for their hit song &quot;Flirtin' with Disaster&quot; from the album of the same title. The band, founded by Dave Hlubek and Steve Holland, took its name from a prostitute who allegedly mutilated and decapitated her clients. Most of Molly Hatchet album covers feature heroic fantasy inspired art, some of which were painted by artists Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo and Paul R. Gregory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Guts...No Glory is the fifth studio album by American southern rock band Molly Hatchet, released in 1983. Original vocalist Danny Joe Brown returns for this recording, with a new rhythm section composed of bassist Riff West (ex-White Witch) and drummer Barry Borden (ex-Mother's Finest). It is their only album not to feature an epic, fantasy themed cover.\n\nThe cover photo for the album was reportedly shot at Six Gun Territory, a now defunct theme park in Ocala, Florida.\n\nThe album contains the popular song, &quot;Fall of the Peacemakers&quot;, which includes overt references to John Lennon. During the tour to support the album, guitarist Steve Holland left the band to be replaced by keyboard player John Galvin.\n\n&quot;What's It Gonna Take&quot;, written by Gary O'Connor, was also recorded by the band Fast Forward and appears on their 1984 album Living in Fiction.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\nDanny Joe Brown: vocals\nDave Hlubek: guitar, assistant producer\nSteve Holland: guitar\nDuane Roland: guitar, assistant producer\nRiff West: bass\nBarry &quot;B.B.&quot; Borden: drums\n\n\n\nAdditional Musicians: \n\nDru Lombar: guitar\nJai Winding: keyboards\nJohn Galvin: keyboards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55f36fc2ea6588358fc92e702f98f409664bead","amp;dn":"Molly+Hatchet+-+No+Guts...+No+Glory+%5B1983%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55f36fc2ea6588358fc92e702f98f409664bead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,95,54,252,46,166,88,131,88,252,146,231,2,249,143,64,150,100,190,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
