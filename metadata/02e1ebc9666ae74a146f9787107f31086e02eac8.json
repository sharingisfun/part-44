Thomas Krause poses the question, &quot;What does it take to be a great safety leader?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and answers with a comprehensive new model for understanding safety leadership as it affects organizational culture and safety climate. Leading with Safety defines the practices, tools, and systems essential to creating an injury-free workplace, including the role of employees at each level, special considerations for coaching the senior executive leader, and the two crucial aspects of human performance that every leader needs to know. Ending with inspiring real-world examples or organizations that have put these tools into practice, Leading with Safety is written for any leader who wants to lead with safety toward a more robust, productive and effective organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e1ebc9666ae74a146f9787107f31086e02eac8","amp;dn":"Leading+with+Safety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e1ebc9666ae74a146f9787107f31086e02eac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,225,235,201,102,106,231,74,20,111,151,135,16,127,49,8,110,2,234,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
