And what a compilation it is: Bringing together some of the band's best material as well as some of its craziest, Music for Your Mother does the business for any self-respecting P-Funk clone. Given that the focus is on A- and B-sides rather than album cuts, it isn't a truly exhaustive overview -- that would require the inclusion of songs like &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; and &quot;Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow,&quot; for a start. It's a small quibble in context, though, especially given the inclusion of a number of songs that never made it onto the original eight albums. Most notable is a curious rarity, the semi-smooth soul &quot;I Miss My Baby&quot; single, which was credited to U.S., with music by Funkadelic (U.S. being a group led by eventual P-Funk guitarist Gary Shider). As for the other B-sides and uncollected numbers, they're an understandably mixed but often interesting bunch, including alternate instrumental takes of &quot;Music for Your Mother&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Know if It's Good to You,&quot; the unreleased &quot;Can't Shake It Loose&quot; single, the gospel/feedback freakout &quot;Open Our Eyes,&quot; and the hilariously titled &quot;Fish, Chips and Sweat.&quot; The amazing bonus to the whole collection is the exhaustive 24-page booklet, reviewing the entire early history of Funkadelic via archival photos and a slew of interviews with the surviving participants. Plenty of fun tales are told, but George Clinton didn't participate -- not surprising, given the unflattering picture eventually painted of him -- while the depressing fates of Eddie Hazel and Tawl Ross get deserved attention.\n\n\nDisc 1\n1.Music for My Mother (5:18)\n2.
