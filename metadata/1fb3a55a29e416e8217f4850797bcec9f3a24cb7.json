In the space of the time between her 2009 debut Sweet Prudence and her self-titled follow up, A. Wolf and Her Claws, Wolf has undergone both a name change and a band recruitment (adding vibraphonist Joey Van Phillips, keyboardist/vocalist Linnea Mohn, and synthesist/programmer Jesse Whitney). She has also transitioned from a homespun folktronic artist to a fully-fledged practitioner of electronic pop. Even WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s look has changed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seeing her now with an ultra-modern haircut and prominent tattoos itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to even recall the acoustic-toting rural Illinois gal of just a few years back.\n\nStill, while much has changed about WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s look and sound certain things do remain constant. On her new record the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pipes are as pristine as ever. While she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spend much time looping and mixing her vocal tracks (which for a while looked like the direction she was headed) Wolf leads each tune with the limitless confidence of someone with a flawless singing voice. On vox Wolf is also ably backed by the talented Linnea Mohn, a scene veteran who also currently sings in Rogue Valley.\n\nLyrically speaking Wolf is still an intimately personal songwriter. When she details the everyday struggles of life, she casts herself as protagonist and inflects each song with uplifting and empowering themes. Whether sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrestling with her own metaphorical artistic demons or moving on from a failed romance, WolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words are like a mantra for anti-defeatism. Even in her most fragile moments, which here seems to be lovely piano-inflected tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Disassembled,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Wolf sounds far more interested in growing and learning than she is in feeling sorry for herself.\n\nA. Wolf and Her Claws contains a full, pop-oriented sound that skews electronic but also incorporates slight elements of dub/reggae and hip hop. While Wolf doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rap per se, she does occasionally take on vocal cadences that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too far off of the fact. Occasionally one canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but hear some similarities to local rapper Dessa, who Wolf frequently performs with and who has in fact, made a recent vocal transition of her own (in her case from hip hop to R&amp;B). The dub/reggae footprint is pretty small, but on tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zero to 60Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“All This TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the synths definitely take on a flavor that is distinctly Caribbean. And while those particular tunes lend the album a poppy, dance feel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the tone is balanced out overall by the addition of a healthy dose of slower, heavier songs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb3a55a29e416e8217f4850797bcec9f3a24cb7","amp;dn":"A.+Wolf+%26amp%3B+Her+Claws+-+A.+Wolf+%26amp%3B+Her+Claws+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb3a55a29e416e8217f4850797bcec9f3a24cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,179,165,90,41,228,22,232,33,127,72,80,121,123,206,201,243,162,76,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
