It was done by using a Hauppauge recorder to record it from the 7Plus site.\nI cannot do a webrip from there because it is encrypted. The picture is a little bit stilted throughout it and there is not much I could do about that. The reason I missed the actual cap was because I was rushed to hospital to have another heart operation. I am posting this because I cannot see an alternative cap anywhere and I am also still in hospital and this episode does not appear to be repeated on TV.\nI have also had multiple requests for it too! It is not awful lol! It is just not the best ever!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d780bcd0bac1ce75c287253d742abd052e2283cc","amp;dn":"Beauty.and.the.Geek.AU.s06e04.WebRip.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d780bcd0bac1ce75c287253d742abd052e2283cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,128,188,208,186,193,206,117,194,135,37,61,116,42,189,5,46,34,131,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
