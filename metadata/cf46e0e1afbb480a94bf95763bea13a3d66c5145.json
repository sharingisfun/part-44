Visit them at www.unclecrispy.com\n\tI believe all the videos are Copyright free, since you can just download them at their website.\n\tCover arts were downloaded from http://www.mrazturbation.com/\n\tAll of the videos are at the Uncle Crispy'sChannel under this playlist,you can see if you like them before downloading, the quality is the same.\n\n     These are the videos that started Uncle Crispy Productions... one thursday night we brought 2 cameras to a show, the next day the first Uncle Crispy video was edited, and the rest is history. This was one of the last times the band performed at Java Joes without mics. This was also Jason's second show after having recorded his Elektra Album, so some of the songs were still new. It is a classic Java Joe's show, just Jason, Toca &amp; Ian and a coffee shop full of fans!\n\n\nRecording Equipment:\nQ: What type of video/audio gear do you use\nA: We have two cameras, the 3-CCD Sony TRV950 and a 1-CCD Sony TRV27. Both shoot in MiniDV and we use the TRV950 as the main camera when possible. There is a very stark difference between the colors and lighting of the two cameras, I highly recommend a 3CCD MiniDV camera if you are looking to purchase. For audio we generally use a Nomad Jukebox 3 with AT831 Mics and an SP-SPSC-1 batt. box but we've also used the internal mic on the camera in some cases.\n\n\n\nd1t01 Intro\nd1t02 Toca &amp; Ian Introductions\nd1t03 On Love, In Sadness\nd1t04 Too Much Food\nd1t05 Common Pleasure Intro\nd1t06 Common Pleasure\nd1t07 Who Needs Shelter\nd1t08 Creed Impersonation\nd1t09 Little You &amp; I\nd1t10 You &amp; I Both (Polka Version)\nd1t11 So UnusualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\nd2t01 1,000 Things\nd2t02 Unfold\nd2t03 Dreamlife Of Rand McNally\nd2t04 Older Lover Undercover %\nd2t05 Curbside Prophet %\nd2t06 Say Anything Game %#\n[ 10 Minute Intermission ]\nd2t07 I'll Do Anything\nd2t08 The Remedy\nd2t09 Did I Fool Ya?\nd2t10 BetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\nDISC 2 TOTALÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\nd3t01 Sleeping To Dream Intro\nd3t02 Sleeping To Dream\nd3t03 Absolutely Zero\nd3t04 Zero Percent Interest\nd3t05 Sleep All Day Intro *\nd3t06 Sleep All Day\nd3t07 10,000 Motherfuckers @\n\n% with BushwallaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n# with Pete Thurston on Electric Guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨* with Cheryce (Audience Participant)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨\n@ Jason solo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf46e0e1afbb480a94bf95763bea13a3d66c5145","amp;dn":"Jason+Mraz+Live+at+Java+Joes+2002+2002-06-27+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf46e0e1afbb480a94bf95763bea13a3d66c5145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,70,224,225,175,187,72,10,148,191,149,118,59,234,19,163,214,108,81,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
