Now updated and enhanced with numerous worked examples, homework problems, and illustrations, and a rich selection of Web-based learning resources, the new Sixth Edition continues to present a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of classical thermodynamics, while retaining an engineering perspective.\nThe text lays the groundwork for subsequent studies in fields such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer and statistical thermodynamics, and prepares students to effectively apply thermodynamics in the practice of engineering.\n\n\nContents\nSome Introductory Comments.\nSome Concepts and Definitions.\nProperties of a Pure Substance.\nWork and Heat.\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics.\nFirst Law Analysis for a Control Volume.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics.\nEntropy.\nSecond Law Analysis for a Control Volume.\nIrreversibility and Availability.\nPower and Refrigeration Systems.\nGas Mixtures.\nThermodynamic Relations.\nChemical Reactions.\nIntroduction to Phase and Chemical Equilibrium.\nCompressible Flow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:653d06db52b789d319b927884eabef04b98d4c48","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Thermodynamics+6th+Edition+by+Sonntag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"653d06db52b789d319b927884eabef04b98d4c48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,61,6,219,82,183,137,211,25,185,39,136,78,171,239,4,185,141,76,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
