Blues Can't Even Find Me (03:35)\n\nThe tone and pace shifts throughout John Hiatt's Mystic Pinball, the 60-year-old's 21st album.\nOf the fast, 'rockier' songs, the opening track We're Alright Now and It All Comes Back work well, although the perfunctory groove of Bite Marks detract from the sassy lyrics.\nWood Chipper is a dark song which manages to mix grisly murder and Little Debbie Snack cakes in Hiatt's assured, deadpan way. I Just Don't Know What To Say is a coolly detached ballad of sadness, while One Of Them Damn Days is a painfully dismal account of alcoholic regret.\nThe highlight is an affecting ballad called No Wicked Grin. It's Hiatt at his tender best. The album has some fine searing electric and gentle acoustic guitar from Doug Lancio, ably assisted by bassist Patrick OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hearn and drummer Kenneth Blevins, with Kevin Shirley as producer.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf0f0483696825382e823c5090d72204808a2c0","amp;dn":"John+Hiatt+-+Mystic+Pinball+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf0f0483696825382e823c5090d72204808a2c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,240,240,72,54,150,130,83,130,232,35,197,9,13,114,32,72,8,162,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
