Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485cd6b2984182ffa23dff170a5a688c4d0bdd06","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23300+-+Joey+Diaz+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485cd6b2984182ffa23dff170a5a688c4d0bdd06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,92,214,178,152,65,130,255,162,61,255,23,10,90,104,140,77,11,221,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
