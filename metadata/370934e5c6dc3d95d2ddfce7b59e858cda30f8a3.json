From winning &quot;Star Search&quot; back in 1985 and seeing him on television from &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;The Sinbad Show&quot; and the host of &quot;Vibe&quot;.\nBut for a comedian who has been on television for nearly two decades, when you haven't been seen for several years, people start to question if you're dead and in the case of the comedian, rumors filled the social media realm and Wikipedia that the comedian has died. That was until Dec. 2009 when the comedian was featured in the media for his tax problems.\nFortunately, the comedian hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. In fact, Sinbad's latest Comedy Central DVD &quot;Where U Been?&quot; is a sign that there are comedians that still can entertain and get the audience going crazy after a performance.\nAs his Comedy Central performance will be airing on television, the DVD features 45 minutes of material not shown on television. This latest performance is actually one of the best performances I have seen from Sinbad and that is watching him perform his comedy routines for years.\nSinbad goes into his routine about where he has been all these years, to his financial problems but easily transitions to that he's no different from millions Americans who are facing hard times during the country's economic slump.\n From topics of President Obama, to relationships, taking questions from the audience especially from the ladies of what problems they have with their men and so much covered on this DVD.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00001_zpsd62ae16d.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00001_zpsd62ae16d.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00002_zpsebb1ca7b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00002_zpsebb1ca7b.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00003_zpsd78a6574.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Multi%202/vlcsnap-00003_zpsd78a6574.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
