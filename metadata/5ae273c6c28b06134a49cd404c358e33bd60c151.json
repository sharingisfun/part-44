Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville (familiar to fans of Leigh's previous films) star as Phil and Penny, a common-law husband and wife who toil their gloomy days away as a cab-driver and grocery-store cashier, respectively. When the couple come to realize the growing emptiness in their relationship, an unexpected emergency within their family brings them closer together and offers the possibility of reigniting the long-extinguished spark in their marriage. Hoping to repeat the Palm D'or win of Leigh's 1996 film Secrets and Lies, All or Nothing was screened in competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae273c6c28b06134a49cd404c358e33bd60c151","amp;dn":"Mike+Leigh-All+or+Nothing+%282002%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae273c6c28b06134a49cd404c358e33bd60c151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,226,115,198,194,139,6,19,74,73,205,64,76,53,142,51,189,96,193,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
