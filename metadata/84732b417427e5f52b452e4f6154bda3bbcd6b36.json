The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach.\r\n\r\nWith The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas donâ€™t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of â€œnormal science,â€ as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age.\r\n\r\nThis new edition of Kuhnâ€™s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhnâ€™s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hackingâ€™s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84732b417427e5f52b452e4f6154bda3bbcd6b36","amp;dn":"The+Structure+of+Scientific+Revolutions+by+Thomas+Kuhn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84732b417427e5f52b452e4f6154bda3bbcd6b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,115,43,65,116,39,229,245,43,69,46,79,97,84,189,163,187,205,107,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
