Developed by Chris Sawyer and published by Infogrames, the game was released on October 15, 2002. It is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon and is the second game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is followed by RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.\n\nhe premise of the game is to complete scenarios by successfully building and maintaining theme parks. Players can choose many roller coaster types and can also build other rides. The player can also build their own roller coaster. Furthermore, the player can modify the land and theme of the park. Players must also satisfy the needs of the visitors by building food stalls, drink stands, bathrooms, souvenir shops, and facilities, like ATMs, information kiosks, and more. Players must balance their budget in their expenses and income.\n\nOne of the most notable differences from the original game is that RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 features a more robust system for building structures. In the original game (expansion packs only), the player could create large buildings by raising the terrain in blocks and then painting in wall textures, roof tiles, and windows on the cliffs. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, the player can create buildings by laying each piece of wall and roof pieces individually. To make constructing buildings easier, the player can lock the position of a wall or roof piece by holding the SHIFT key and moving the mouse up and down to adjust the height. The CTRL key can be held down to lock in the height of a piece. These changes gave the player much greater flexibility when it came to constructing buildings. Using the SHIFT key, the player can also raise or lower any ride or shop to a desired elevation, allowing for entire rides and shops to be built underground. Previously, only rides that had tracks could be built underground, since the player had to build the first piece above the ground, then extend the track below ground afterwards.\n\nTwo expansion packs were released for RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. The first, Wacky Worlds, is a world-themed expansion. All seven continents of the world are featured; each has a unique park entrance, large scenery group, and several attractions themed to it. The second expansion pack, Time Twister, is based on a time theme. It is somewhat similar to Wacky Worlds in that the new scenarios are presented as additions to the existing RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 ones, and that there are several major new themes, each with plenty of new rides, scenery, and a park entrance. Both of these expansion packs are now available in a Triple Thrill Pack with RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.  \n\nSystem Reqs:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows 98/Me/XP/2K\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pentium II 300 Mhz, \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Memory: 64 MB (128 recomended)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Videocard: 8 Mb\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DirectX: 8.1+\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ HD: 800 Mb\n\n\nNotes:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Credits: Banshee &amp; Solenbum\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Nothing ripped.
