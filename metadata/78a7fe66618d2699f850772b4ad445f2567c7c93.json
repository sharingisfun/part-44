He dropped out of high school to pursue the venture full-time, and two years later sold ClickAgents for $40 million, making him one of the youngest self-made millionaires in history and allowing him and his entire family to realize their dreams. Chahal went on to become the youngest executive of a multi-billion dollar NASDAQ-listed company, and then sold his second company, BlueLithium, to Yahoo! for $300 million, turning many of his employees into multi-millionaires as well.\n\nIn The Dream, ChahalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refreshing advice for entrepreneurs encourages them to embrace risk and to carve out new niches in the marketplace. He emphasizes the value of good business timing: how to execute an idea and get it to the marketplace, how to create and maintain solid business relationships, how to stay grounded, and - most importantly - how to teach yourself that failure is not an option. ChahalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story not only shows how a 16-year-old immigrant overcame discrimination and adversity to fulfill his highest ambitions, but also provides aspiring entrepreneurs with valuable hands-on advice on how to achieve success.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;While success like his is often attributed to luck, Chahal's story, like that of many immigrants, is more one of sacrifice... it was years of hard work, persistence and faith, along with the support of his family, that brought his financial rewards--not chance.&quot;\n--San Francisco Chronicle\n\n&quot;Chahal is a prodigy, a successful entrepreneur, and a writer. His story is remarkable and we think it is a prime example of what can be accomplished with a little motivation and ingenuity. Young Hollywood wants to know what this young man canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do!&quot;\n--Young Hollywood\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGurbaksh Chahal is an internet business entrepreneur and self-made multi-millionaire.
