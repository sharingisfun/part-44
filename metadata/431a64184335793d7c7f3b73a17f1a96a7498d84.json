Initiating a scan and clean is straightforward.\nPowerful: CCleaner includes most of the essentials for PC maintenance. It provides tools for clearing your temporary files, cleaning the Registry, and removing unused cookies from your browser. CCleaner also supports 64-bit systems, as well as updated support for popular applications.\nFreeware: Upselling and bundling are minimal; CCleaner only offers the option to install Google Chrome, which users can easily opt out of. Compared to other free programs, CCleaner is the least ad-heavy.\nCons\n\nRegistry cleaning: If used incorrectly, CCleaner is capable of doing more harm than good. Always exercise caution when cleaning your Registry -- create a backup before starting cleanup.\nBottom Line\n\nCCleaner is effective at removing junk files and unnecessary temporary Internet files. While using it won't dramatically improve your system performance, it's nevertheless a fine addition to your utility collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:431a64184335793d7c7f3b73a17f1a96a7498d84","amp;dn":"CCleaner+v4.14.4707+Business+%26amp%3B+Professional+Edition+Incl.+%7B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"431a64184335793d7c7f3b73a17f1a96a7498d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,26,100,24,67,53,121,61,124,127,59,115,161,127,26,150,167,73,141,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
