Over the succeeding decades, Tucker became one of the few child performers to mature into adulthood without losing her audience, and during the course of her career, she notched a remarkable streak of Top Ten and Top 40 hits.\n\nTucker was born in Seminole, TX, and much of her childhood was spent moving throughout the Southwest as her father pursued construction jobs. At the age of six she began taking saxophone lessons; two years later she decided she wanted to sing, and made an auspicious debut with Mel Tillis, who was so impressed by her talents that he invited her on-stage to perform. In 1969 Tucker and her family moved to Las Vegas, where she regularly performed. Eventually, she recorded a demo tape that gained the attention of songwriter Dolores Fuller, who sent it to producer Billy Sherrill. At the time, Sherrill was the head of A&amp;R at CBS Records, and he was so impressed with the demo tape that he signed the teenaged vocalist to Columbia Records. Sherrill initially planned to have Tucker record &quot;The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA,&quot; but she passed on the tune, choosing &quot;Delta Dawn&quot; -- a song she heard Bette Midler sing on The Tonight Show -- instead. Released in the spring of 1972, the song became an instant hit, peaking at number six on the country charts and scraping the bottom of the pop charts.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Here's Some Love\n02.Ridin' Rainbows\n03.Pride Of Franklin County\n04.Dancing The Night Away\n05.Wait 'Till Daddy Finds Out\n06.Let's Keep It That Way\n07.San Antonio Stroll\n08.Don't Believe My Heart Can Stand Another You\n09.Short Cut\n10.You've Got Me To Hold On To\n11.Lizzie And The Rain Man\n12.It's A Cowboy Lovin' Night\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585c608e0788e4ac688636bd6b9239340f843221","amp;dn":"Tanya+Tucker+-+Greatest+Hits+%281978%29+%5BCDRip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585c608e0788e4ac688636bd6b9239340f843221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,92,96,142,7,136,228,172,104,134,54,189,107,146,57,52,15,132,50,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
