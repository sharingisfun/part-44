Starting with the wild plants that were central to our original diet, investigative journalist Jo Robinson describes how 400 generations of farmers have unwittingly squandered a host of essential fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. New research shows that these losses have made us more vulnerable to our most troubling conditions and diseases--obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation, and dementia.\n\nIn an engaging blend of science and story, Robinson describes how and when we transformed the food in the produce aisles. Wild apples, for example, have from three to 100 times more antioxidants than Galas and Honeycrisps, and are five times more effective in killing cancer cells. Compared with spinach, one of our present-day &quot;superfoods,&quot; wild dandelion leaves have eight times more antioxidant activity, two times more calcium, three more times vitamin A, and five times more vitamins K and E.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0f07463673f62f6cafd357a81bae4b58bc628d","amp;dn":"Eating+on+the+Wild+Side%3A+The+Missing+Link+to+Optimum+Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0f07463673f62f6cafd357a81bae4b58bc628d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,15,7,70,54,115,246,47,108,175,211,87,168,27,174,75,88,188,98,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
