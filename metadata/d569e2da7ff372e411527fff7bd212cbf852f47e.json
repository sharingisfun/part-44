The album's done in close collaboration with David Axelrod Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who'd handled Cannon's big live dates for Capitol in the 60s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but this record is much more freewheeling, open-ended, fuzz, funky, and electric overall! Tracks are all nice and long, and really trip out in the best way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with keyboards from George Duke in the core group, plus some heavy basslines from Walter Booker, drums from Roy McCurdy, and guitar from Mike Deasy on a number of key tracks.\n\nDeasy plays with lots of great wah wah and fuzz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the album also features guest work from Airto on percussion and Ernie Watts on tenor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus Cannonball's great alto and the cornet of brother Nat Adderley too. There's a really collaborative feel to the whole thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the record steps easily between a lot of heady styles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include &quot;Zanek&quot;, &quot;Eye Of The Cosmos&quot;, &quot;The Scene&quot;, &quot;The Chocolate Nuisance&quot;, &quot;The Steam Drill&quot;, &quot;Little Benny Hen&quot;, and &quot;The Black Messiah&quot;.\n\nRecorded Live at The Troubadour, Los Angeles California in 1971.-\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - Introduction\n02 - Black Messiah\n03 - Monologue\n04 - Little Benny Hen\n05 - Zanek\n06 - Dr. Honouris Causa\n\nCD2\n01 - The Chocolate Nuisance\n02 - Untitled\n03 - The Steam Drill\n04 - Eyes Of The Cosmos\n05 - Episode From The Music Came\n06 - Heritage\n07 - Circumference\n08 - Pretty Paul\n09 - The Scene\n\n*2014 Blue Note / Real Gone Music / Dusty Groove | RGM-0247\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\nCannonball Adderley - alto &amp; soprano saxophone\nNat Adderley - cornet\nRoy McCurdy - drums\nWalter Booker - bass\nGeorge Duke - piano\nAirto Moreira - percussion\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, Seed and Sharing.
