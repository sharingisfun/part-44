It plays acoustic and electric versions of original and traditional blues songs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLive at Sweetwater is a live Hot Tuna album recorded in 1992 at Mill Valley, CA. It was their first new recording made for Relix Records, although they had previously released older performances with Relix (Splashdown, Historic Hot Tuna). Appearing on the album with Hot Tuna was Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, blues-singer Maria Muldaur, and keyboardist Pete Sears who ended up staying with the band for ten years. In 2004 Eagle Records re-mastered and re-released the album with several added tracks, and some previous tracks shortened in length.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBand:\n\nJorma Kaukonen: lead guitar, vocals, dobro, table steel guitar\nJack Casady: bass\nMichael Falzarano: rhythm guitar, vocals, mandolin, harmonica\n\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\nMaria Muldaur: vocals\nPete Sears: keyboards\nBob Weir: rhythm guitar, vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c339cd9e33004b0ecbfe7bf77ef432bd0e979b36","amp;dn":"Hot+Tuna+-+Live+At+Sweetwater+%5B1992%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c339cd9e33004b0ecbfe7bf77ef432bd0e979b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,57,205,158,51,0,75,14,203,254,123,247,126,244,50,189,14,151,155,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
