Mann's hit version of &quot;Comin' Home Baby&quot; from this live set became his first big hit.  Composer Ben Tucker plays second bass on that cut, and Mann's other sidemen include vibraphonist Hagood Hardy, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, drummer Rudy Collins, and Chief Bey and Ray Mantilla on percussion.  In addition to &quot;Comin' Home Baby,&quot; Mann and his men perform memorable versions of &quot;Summertime&quot; and &quot;It Ain't Necessarily So&quot;; the latter is 20 minutes long.
