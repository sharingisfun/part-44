One word sort of sums up this show: WOW!  And that was just what Dave had to say as the band took the stage that night in Milwaukee.  With such a large percentage of the crowd a little wrinkly from partying all night before at the Halloween show just down the road in Chicago, the band did everyone a favor and started out the set with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sleepy Monkey.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  After finding their way to and through Ã¢â‚¬Å“Makes Sense To MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gradle,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just Kissed My BabyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provided the perfect launching point for the eveningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦as if the opener didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take care of that itself! After Mikey gave us Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smoke and Burn,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“HappyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wondering,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jojo continued his Mardi Gras moodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦that kept running right through the encoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦with a little Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sick and TiredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ / Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake, Rattle and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ back and forth that got everybody hopping around for sure. Once JB sensed it was time for some chicken, the boys served up some Ã¢â‚¬Å“Contentment BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a little Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love TractorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to end what was certainly a wake up call for set two.\n\nWith the required seat belt check and a little prayer for the captain and crew, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re off again with Ã¢â‚¬Å“AirplaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to begin the second half of the nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey.  After eventually landing on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aunt AvisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then finding that quiet space again, Mikey rips into Ã¢â‚¬Å“B of DÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and talk about taking off!  Whew!  Ã¢â‚¬Å“JackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes in right on cue to give everyone a chance to catch their breath, again.  Just then, out of nowhere we get a Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Dear Mr. FantasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with JB throwing in his originality and Mikey just completely shredding the place and then taking a Ã¢â‚¬Å“where are we now?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ break againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦just before venturing into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guilded SplintersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦which just set the tone for the remainder of the show. Returning to Ã¢â‚¬Å“GuildedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after Sunny and Todd did their thing, everyone still had a bit left to go with a meaty Ã¢â‚¬Å“DinerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and then a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tall BoyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to wash it all down. The encores were certainly approriate with Ã¢â‚¬Å“And It Stoned MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Red BeansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ giving the crowd the high five ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Yeah, boy howdyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ that was a great show and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not done with Mardi Gras in Milwaukee in November just yet.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd, thankfully, neither are we!  So, as the band had just about finished up its midwestern swing of shows through Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, it became evident once again that they can hit on all cylinders when the crowd expects itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦like that Halloween show in ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and even maybe when they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬Â¦like this next night in Milwaukee.   But for that matter, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really recall ever being at a show where I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think great things were getting ready to happen.  And when you combine a room full like-minded people with a band and their unique ability to channel that energyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I guess what you get is Widespread Panic.\n\nHey, speaking of trying to hit on all cylindersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this show gives us a good example of a Porch Song pick and what influenced it.  As I wrote a few months ago describing the series and the potential picks, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m out there looking for some intersecting points where a certain show deserves archive consideration, but, for whatever reason, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly unlikely that it will be able to get the Multi-Track love.  In the case of Milwaukee 1996, I first and foremost looked to the huge amount of support this show has always had from both the fansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective.  I then considered a) the lack of a soundboard copy in current circulation among the tapers and b) what I found to be non-existent MT tapes in the vault.  But never one to give up, a thorough vault search did unearth this 2 Track Soundboard recording, and even though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not perfectÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it does go a long way in documenting a show that was certainly close to perfection.
