And...oh yes--we redefine the very NATURE OF THE COSMOS!!!\n\nAssuming, of course, that Jack can find his lost dog, Nigel.\n\n\nGETTING THE UIDC ONTO YOUR PSP:\n   1. Download the .CBR files\n   2. Uncompress the .CBR file with WinRar or any other compression software compatible with .CBR files.\n   3. Save the images you just uncompressed from the .CBR file to your PSP's Memory Stick Duo. If you have formatted the Memory Stick with a PSP the proper folders structure will be automatically created. If the Memory Stick has not been formatted, you will need to create a folder named &quot;PSP&quot; on the Memory Stick and then another called &quot;PHOTO&quot; within the &quot;PSP&quot; folder. The .CBR file will contain a folder title &quot;theuidc - Issue X&quot; -- where &quot;X&quot; is replaced with the issue number you are putting there. Save this entire folder within the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder or save the individual image files directly to the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder. The PSP will not recognize sub-folders more than one level deep within the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder. For example you cannot have &quot;PHOTO &gt; UIDC&gt; UIDC - PART1&quot;. However, you could do this &quot;PHOTO &gt;  THE UIDC&quot;. Save the files to the Memory Stick using one of the following methods:\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ Using a commercially available USB cable\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ Using a PC with a Memory Stick slot\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ Using a commercially available Memory Stick USB reader/writer\n\nVIEWING THE UIDC ON YOUR PSP:\n   1. Insert the Memory Stick Duo that contains the files for the issue of nyc2123 you wish to view.\n   2. From the PSP main menu, select the &quot;Photo&quot; icon using the X button.\n   3. If you saved the images to a sub-folder, scroll to that folder and select the folder using the X button.\n   4. Select the image you wish to view (we recommend starting at the beginning with 01.JPG) and press the X button.\n   5. Use the L and R &quot;shoulder&quot; buttons, scroll through the pages of nyc2123.\n   6. Enjoy.\n\nVIEWING THE UIDC ON YOUR PC\n   \n    1. Use a .CBR reader \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6685f71186098b946a94949d3ccd803806b05e","amp;dn":"UIDC+Parts+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6685f71186098b946a94949d3ccd803806b05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,102,133,247,17,134,9,139,148,106,148,148,157,60,205,128,56,6,176,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
