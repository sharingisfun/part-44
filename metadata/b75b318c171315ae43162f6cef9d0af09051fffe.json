Natalie Imbruglia, Mel C, Suggs and k.d. lang are among those whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve benefited from his pen and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been an influential collaborator with others, notably Eddi Reader, for whom he produced the highly successful Sings the Songs of Robert Burns.\n\nOn his first band album for over a decade, we find his finely crafted songs and gently assured voice surrounded by a strong supporting cast, including John McCusker on fiddle, Alan Kelly on accordion, Ewen Vernal on double bass, Stephen Douglas on drums, the amazing Gustaf Ljunggren on keyboards, lap steel and woodwind and Heidi Talbot on backing vocals. Together they contrive a suitably delicate backdrop for HewerdineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s smoothly shaped material without ever swamping him, resulting in an album of unusual class and sensitivity.\n\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect tub-thumping mantras. These are classic, melody-driven love songs which would have been gobbled up by Tin Pan Alley in another era but now, draped in sympathetic, subtle arrangements, offer a soothing antidote to the frantic madness of modern times. Not unlike Richard HawleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bittersweet portrayals of Sheffield, Hewerdine paints his scenarios with beguiling attention to detail. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLying in bed with her the first time I heard Graceland play,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he sings, poignantly reflecting on the perils of long-distance love on Geography; and whether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the war-time lovers who search for one other on In Paris After the War or the familiar rituals of self-examination and rebirth of New YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Eve, he generally rises above the cascade of sentiment that occasionally threatens to tip into pathos to apply proper emotional values.\n\nA jazzy undercurrent here, a folkie adornment there, but these are timeless songs for all seasons.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/17/boo-hewerdine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/17/boo-hewerdine/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b75b318c171315ae43162f6cef9d0af09051fffe","amp;dn":"Boo+Hewerdine...God+Bless+the+Pretty+Things%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b75b318c171315ae43162f6cef9d0af09051fffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,91,49,140,23,19,21,174,67,22,47,108,239,157,10,240,144,81,255,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
