In the two years since his accident, Ryan has suffered a lack of self-esteem, dropped out of school and become unemployed. Deep down, he knows he might waste his second chance at life if he can't get to a healthy weight, but he spends most of his time at home and eating fast food. A former high school football player and a devoted Green Bay Packers football fan, Ryan learns that Chris Powell has chosen him to participate in a weight loss journey while visiting Lambeau Field's Packers Hall of Fame. In addition to setting his goal weight at 195 lbs., Ryan wants to overcome his fear of riding a bike. A low point during his one-year journey includes a disturbing discovery during a routine medical test; and special moments include surprise visits from Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews and famed wide receiver Donald Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3346ae1f3786e12d8676f0dbf8a4bd8c9fa942ce","amp;dn":"Extreme+Weight+Loss+S03E03+Ryan+HDTV+x264+%5BNY2%5D+%28previously+Extr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3346ae1f3786e12d8676f0dbf8a4bd8c9fa942ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,70,174,31,55,134,225,45,134,118,240,219,248,164,189,140,159,169,66,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
