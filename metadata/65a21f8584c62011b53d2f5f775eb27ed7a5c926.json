Or maybe not...as Steven, a handsome young theater history professor discovers when he sets out to write a stage thriller - a plain, old generic thriller - only to discover that his characters prefer a character study - and want it to be a movie, not a play. At least Steven can create the man of his dreams, right? But that character - Vertigo - named after Steven's sixth grade teacher Mr. Vertigo (Steven always dates men named Vertigo) - isn't really cooperating. Will Steven ever finish his play? Will Vertigo behave (or rather, misbehave) as Steven wishes? And what about the friends on whom Steven is basing his other characters - will they still be his friends when it's all over? \n\n\n01:22:06\n576x320\n29.97 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a21f8584c62011b53d2f5f775eb27ed7a5c926","amp;dn":"2009+Generic+Thriller+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a21f8584c62011b53d2f5f775eb27ed7a5c926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,162,31,133,132,198,32,17,181,61,47,95,119,94,178,126,215,165,201,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
