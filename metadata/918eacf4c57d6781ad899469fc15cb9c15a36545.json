Her songs have been used in episodes of the television series Castle, Grey's Anatomy, Bones, 90210, and Orange Is The New Black.\n \nAlbum Review: Sara Jackson-Holman - River Queen (Expunged Records) Source: wweek.com\n\n[PUSHING POP] It seems like a River Styx reference is right there. Portland-based Sara Jackson-Holman opens her latest EP, River Queen, with the line, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take me with you when you go to the depths of your despair.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the conveyance on a river, but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite make it to the literary nod. Instead, the piano-dominated track gets swamped with drum programming and a chorus that could again land the singerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work on network television. But toting around a voice like hers should enable the Central Oregon native to ditch the lesser trappings of pop music. By the time River Queen reaches Ã¢â‚¬Å“Keep Score,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jackson-Holman has drifted through enough pop offerings to sate teenage mallrats and finally hits on a uniquely composed piece, with her piano-playing largely unadorned by additional accompaniment. As her voice flits across the song, a special sort of unforced grandeur emerges, something noticeably absent from the more radio-ready work dashed across the rest of the EP. Crafting an entire album of compositions in the same mode as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Keep ScoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while keeping listenersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attention would be difficult. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty clear the singer understands that, despite getting all tangled up in studio shenanigans. The moments when she sheds pretense and ignores the potential for swelled production flourishes, Jackson-Holman moves beyond the plateau of dime-a-dozen crooners and hints at the possibilities of a substantive, nationwide career.\n \nVBR -V 0 (VBRVO) smaller file size and better quality than a 320CBR placebo :)\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918eacf4c57d6781ad899469fc15cb9c15a36545","amp;dn":"Sara+Jackson-Holman+-+River+Queen+EP++%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918eacf4c57d6781ad899469fc15cb9c15a36545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,142,172,244,197,125,103,129,173,137,148,105,252,21,203,156,21,163,101,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
