At the core of the current financial crisis has been the widely held assumption that markets behave rationally. Fox, Time magazine editor-at-large, isn't the first to bring scrutinyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or censureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the conceit, but his analysis is singularly compelling, and the rare business history that reads like a thriller. Fox leads us on a chronological journey of modern economic theory, featuring the cast of scholars who constructed the 20th- and 21st-century financial landscape, from Irving Fisher to such post-WWII figures as Milton Friedman, Harry Markowitz, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, Jack Treynor and William Sharpe. Fox offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse at academia's finest, complete with amusing anecdotes about the players and their theories, and illustrates how our economic behaviors and markets have been shaped by a gradually refined theory holding that the stock market prices are both random and perfectly rational. A must-read for anyone interested in the markets, our economy or government, this dense but spellbinding work brings modern finance and economics to life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670af1aa365a2a676c8facda24c57e9b19f4f82d","amp;dn":"Justin+Fox+--+The+Myth+of+the+Rational+Market%3A+A+History+of+Risk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670af1aa365a2a676c8facda24c57e9b19f4f82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,10,241,170,54,90,42,103,108,143,172,218,36,197,126,155,25,244,248,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
