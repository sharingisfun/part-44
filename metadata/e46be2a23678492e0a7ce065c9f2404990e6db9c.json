He was Jeronimus Corneliszoon, a disgraced and bankrupt man with great charisma and dangerously heretical ideas. With the help of a few disgruntled sailors, he hatched a plot to seize the ship and her riches. The mutiny might have succeeded, but in the dark morning hours of June 3, 1629, the Batavia smashed through a coral reef and ran aground on a small chain of islands near Australia. The captain and skipper escaped the wreck, and in a tiny lifeboat they set sail for JavaÃ¢â‚¬â€some 1,500 miles northÃ¢â‚¬â€to summon help. More than 250 frightened survivors waded ashore, thankful to be alive. Unfortunately, Jeronimus and the mutineers had survived too, and the nightmare was only beginning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e46be2a23678492e0a7ce065c9f2404990e6db9c","amp;dn":"Batavia%27s+Graveyard-+The+True+Story+of+the+Mad+Heretic+Who+Led+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e46be2a23678492e0a7ce065c9f2404990e6db9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,107,226,162,54,120,73,46,10,124,224,101,201,242,64,73,144,230,219,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
