R. (Bill) Percy Prize, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the humorous tale of a man known only as the King. As his Kingdom careens toward catastrophe, he cruises seedy taverns looking for likely maidens.\n\nHis incompetence and weakness for beautiful women drag him deeper and deeper into trouble. He is portrayed as a cross dresser by the Kingdom Crier (the KingdomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular tabloid). Shortly after, he must defend his castle against a siege, with only his royal fiddlerÃ¢â‚¬â€while attempting to steal his royal fiddlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend.\n\nFans of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, and Monty Python will love this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88851aa1b29492c3d058b72dfd60f95c7822da53","amp;dn":"Royal+Flush+eBook+PDF.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88851aa1b29492c3d058b72dfd60f95c7822da53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,133,26,161,178,148,146,195,208,88,183,45,253,96,249,92,120,34,218,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
