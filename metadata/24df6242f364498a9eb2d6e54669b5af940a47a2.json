Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always so good at effectively removing it.\n\nTrojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by standard antivirus and trojan scanners.\n\nWhat Trjan Remover Does\nTrojan Remover examines all the system files, the Windows Registry and the programs and files loaded at boot time. The majority of malicious programs (once triggered) load this way.\n\nTrojan Remover scans ALL the files loaded at boot time for Adware, Spyware, Remote Access Trojans, Internet Worms and other malware. Trojan Remover also checks to see if Windows loads Services which are hidden by Rootkit techniques and warns you if it finds any.\n\nFor each identified Trojan Horse, Worm, or other malware, Trojan Remover pops up an alert screen which shows the file location and name; it offers to remove the program's reference from the system files and allows you to rename the file to stop its activation.\n\nThe FastScan component of Trojan Remover is set to automatically scan for Malware every time you start your PC (you can disable this if you wish). You can also run the FastScan manually any time you wish (START | Programs | Trojan Remover | FastScan). This FastScan checks all program-loading points - it is a quick and effective check for actively-loading malicious programs.\n\nYou can scan the whole drive, or any directories on the drive, by selecting Scan a Drive/Directory from the main Trojan Remover menu.\n\nInstall Notes\n1. Install the program and do not run.\n2. Copy the patch to prog dir, i,e, &quot;C:Program FilesTrojan Remover&quot;, and run it there and click &quot;Patch&quot;.\n3. DONE!\n\n\n====================================================================================\nNote: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.org/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24df6242f364498a9eb2d6e54669b5af940a47a2","amp;dn":"Trojan+Remover+v6.8.3.2603+%2B+Patch+%5BThumperDC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24df6242f364498a9eb2d6e54669b5af940a47a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,223,98,66,243,100,73,138,158,178,214,229,70,105,181,175,148,10,71,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
