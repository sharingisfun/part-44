This is a high quality TV rip of the UNCENSORED series.  \n\n\nExtended Plot:\n Loved By The Buffalo believes he has found the foretold prophet when a mysterious Indian named Wokova inspires his people with the Ghost Dance and a vision of their restored land. But the ritual stirs up more fear among those who wish to contain the Indians. Sitting Bull is &quot;accidentally&quot; killed, further inciting the Ghost Dance rebellion, which in turn, leads to more brutality toward the Indians. As the circle closes, Loved By The Buffalo and Jacob meet again. Reunited with his family, Loved By The Buffalo resolves to pass on his Lakota traditions to the next generation so that their ways continue to live on.\nWriter: William Mastrosimone\nDirector: Jeremy Podeswa \n \n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Into.the.West.Part6.HDTV.XviD-LOKi.avi\nFilesize.....: 700 MB (or 717,188 KB or 734,400,512 bytes)\nType.........: OpenDML AVI\nRuntime......: 01:29:05 (128,155 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 959 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 132 kb/s (66/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.96\nSample Rate..: 48000 Hz\nFrame Size...: 624x352 (1.77:1) [=39:22]\nFPS..........: 23.976\nQuality......: 0.182 bits/pixel\n\n\nOverview\n\nPlot: Tales from the American West in the 19th century, told from the perspective of two families, one of white settlers and one of Native Americans\n\nDirectors: Robert Dornhelm &amp; Sergio Mimica-Gezzan\nWriters: Kirk Ellis (writer) &amp; William Mastrosimone (writer)\nRelease Date: 10 June 2005 (USA)\nGenre: Western | Adventure | Drama\nPlot Keywords: TV Mini-Series\nAwards: Nominated for Golden Globe.
