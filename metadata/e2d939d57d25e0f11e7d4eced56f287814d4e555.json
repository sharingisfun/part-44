He is one of the three noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds (the other two being Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice.\n\nMuch of Beck's recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound, and his releases have spanned genres ranging from blues rock, heavy metal, jazz fusion and an additional blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Although he recorded two hit albums (in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck has not established or maintained the sustained commercial success of many of his contemporaries and bandmates. Beck appears on albums by Mick Jagger, Tina Turner, Morrissey, Jon Bon Jovi, Malcolm McLaren, Kate Bush, Roger Waters, Donovan, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Zucchero, Cyndi Lauper, Brian May, Stanley Clarke and ZZ Top.\n\nHe was ranked 5th in Rolling Stone's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and the magazine, upon whose cover Beck has appeared three times, has described him as &quot;one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock&quot;. MSNBC has called him a &quot;guitarist's guitarist&quot;. Beck has earned wide critical praise and received the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance six times and Best Pop Instrumental Performance once. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and as a solo artist (2009).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Voorhis &quot;Tim&quot; Bogert III (born August 27, 1944 New York City) is an American musician. He graduated from Ridgefield Memorial High School in his hometown in 1963. As a bass guitarist and vocalist he is best known for his bass solos and his work with Vanilla Fudge, Cactus and the power trio; Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice.\n\nVanilla Fudge was formed along with Mark Stein, Vince Martell, and Carmine Appice. They recorded five albums during the years 1967-69, before disbanding in 1970. The band has reunited in various configurations over the years.\n\nIn 1970 Bogert formed the rock band Cactus with drummer Carmine Appice, guitarist Jim McCarty and Rusty Day, and played with guitarist Jeff Beck, after the second Jeff Beck Group had disbanded in 1972 and eventually became a member of the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice, late in 1972. As a member of the post second Jeff Beck Group, also known as Jeff Beck Group he toured Europe, Japan and US from January 1972 until January 1974. In late 1975, he played bass guitar on Bo Diddley's The 20th Anniversary Of Rock 'n' Roll all-star album.\n\n \nBogert then joined up with Bobby &amp; The Midnites, a musical side project assembled by guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead. Despite touring with the group, Bogert left before their eponymous album was released and was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. He then joined UK group Boxer and played on their final album &quot;Absolutely&quot; in 1977 - he had co-writing credits on three tracks on this album. The album and subsequent tour met with an indifferent response and the band had folded by 1978. During 1981 Bogert toured with guitarist Rick Derringer and released an album Progressions. He recorded his second album Master's Brew in 1983 and recorded Mystery with Vanilla Fudge in 1984. In 1981 Bogert became a faculty member at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood. In 1993 he worked with the Japanese guitarist Pata, also with Carmine Appice and they recorded the album Pata.\n\nIn early 1999 The Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame recognised Tim Bogert's contribution to rock history. Later in 1999 he worked with Triality, and Shelter Me. In 2000 Bogert and Carmine Appice formed the power trio DBA with Rick Derringer and toured with Vanilla Fudge.\n\nIn 2008, Bogert decided to retire from touring. During 2009 Bogert joined blues-rock trio Blues Mobile Band and recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blues Without BordersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2009) in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2010 Bogert, with Mike Onesko on guitar &amp; vocals and Emery Ceo on drums (both from the Blindside Blues Band), recorded Big Electric Cream Jam, a 10-track live tribute to Cream .LIve at The Beachland Ballroom Euclid Ohio.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCarmine Appice (born December 15, 1946) is an American drummer/percussionist, most commonly associated with the rock genre of music. He has received classical music training, and was influenced early-on by the work of jazz drummers Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. Appice is best known for his associations with Vanilla Fudge, Cactus, and the power trio Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice.\n\nAppice is credited with influencing several drummers including Nicko McBrain; Aerosmith's Joey Kramer; Roger Taylor of Queen; Phil Collins; Rush's Neil Peart; Motley Crue's Tommy Lee; Dave Lombardo; Richard Christy; Chris Grainger; David Kinkade; Ray Mehlbaum; Led Zeppelin's John Bonham; Robb Reiner; and, Eric Singer.\n\nHis best-selling drum instruction book The Realistic Rock Drum Method was first published in 1972, and has since been revised and republished as The Ultimate Realistic Rock Drum Method. It covers the basic subjects of rock rhythms and polyrhythms, linear rudiments and groupings, shuffle rhythms, hi-hat, and double bass drum exercises.\n\nOf Italian descent, Appice is the older brother of drummer Vinny Appice by 11 years.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeck, Bogert &amp; Appice is the eponymous debut album by the '70s band Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice. They were a supergroup and power trio, with the line up of guitarist Jeff Beck (who had already been a member of The Yardbirds and The Jeff Beck Group), bassist Tim Bogert, and drummer Carmine Appice (both formerly members of Vanilla Fudge and Cactus). The album had solid sales in 1973 and produced a minor hit single with a cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;Superstition.&quot; This was the band's only studio album, as Beck left the band without warning during the recording of their second album forcing a sudden dissolution in 1974.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nJeff Beck: guitar and vocals\n\nTim Bogert: bass and vocals\n\nCarmine Appice: drums and vocals\n\n\nWith:\n\n\nJimmy Greenspoon: piano\n\nDuane Hitchings: piano, mellotron\n\nDanny Hutton: background vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d939d57d25e0f11e7d4eced56f287814d4e555","amp;dn":"Jeff+Beck+Tim+Bogert+%26amp%3B+Carmine+Appice%5B1973%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d939d57d25e0f11e7d4eced56f287814d4e555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,217,57,213,125,37,224,241,30,125,78,206,213,111,40,120,20,212,229,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
