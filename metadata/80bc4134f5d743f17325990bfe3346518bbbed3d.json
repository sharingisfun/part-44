Farben&amp;#039;s Hidden Power Inside America (1947) which exposes the hidden influence of the German dye trust inside America before and during two world wars. One simply cannot understand the history of the 20th century without understanding the role played in world events by the I.G. Farben company, the chemical cartel that grew out of the German dyestuffs industry. Comprising some of the most important individual companies in the history of industrial capitalism, the firm has dominated the dyestuffs, chemical and pharmaceutical industries before and during World War II. The companies that grew out of I.G.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official dissolution after the warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bayer, Hoechst, BASF, and Agfa continued to be decisive in world markets. Among the many products developed by I.G. or its member companies are: aspirin, heroin, novocain, methadone (originally named Dolophine in honor of Adolph Hitler) and offcourse Zyklon B. Author, an internationally known chemical engineer, sets forth the international scope and economic impact of the company, its role as the spine of the industrial war-making economy of the Third Reich, and the firmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s elevation of Hitler to his position of power. As one observer noted, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHitler was Farben and Farben was Hitler.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Much of the impact that the company wielded derived from its international dominance of the chemical, rubber, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries through its cartel arrangements with partner firms in other countries. FarbenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foreign counterparts had much to do with letting the company and its executives (many of them war criminals of the first order) off the hook after World War II. FarbenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cartel partners abroad constituted an inventory of the wealthiest and most powerful corporations in the world. In the United States, the major firms with which Farben did business included: Du Pont, the Standard Oil companies, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Union Carbide, Dow Chemical and Texaco. In turn, these corporate giants wielded controlling political influence in the United States through the elected and appointed officials in their sway. Attempts at reducing FarbenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence in the United States before and during World War II, as well as efforts at holding the company and its top executives to account for their crimes after the war were neutralized by the cartelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s corporate hirelings and political shills. The story names many names and important ones with every case of sabotage, corruption, propaganda espionage fully documented. In the apendix there are over 250 American corporations which were in one or other way linked to I.G. Farben. It lists like the cream of America&amp;#039;s chemical and metallurgical industries. The author wanted to warn the American nation that the German war effort is being financed by their own industries and that an attempt to stop it must be first made in America and not only abroad. Many facts in this amazing book are revealed to the public for the first time although they were well known to the governments at that time. With the war now being over, the accuracy of author&amp;#039;s forecast can now be seen in all its shocking glory by uncovering the tentacles of I.G. Farben in every element in American social order at this time. TreasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Peace is a vivid, remarkable illustration of the workings of great corporate power both in the United States and abroad. It is must reading for any serious student of political economics and the dynamics of contemporary globalization. 430 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80bc4134f5d743f17325990bfe3346518bbbed3d","amp;dn":"Ambruster-Treason%5C%27s+Peace-I.G.+Farben%5C%27s+Hidden+Power+in+US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80bc4134f5d743f17325990bfe3346518bbbed3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,188,65,52,245,215,67,241,115,37,153,11,254,51,70,81,139,187,237,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
