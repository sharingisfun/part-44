Based on the Hans Christian Anderson story of the same title. Tennant and Lowe proposed Andersen's story as the basis for a new ballet to Sadler's Wells in London in 2007 after a friend, the then Royal Ballet principal, Ivan Putrov, asked Neil Tennant if Pet Shop Boys would consider writing a piece of music for him to dance to at Sadler's Wells. The story is about a competition in a mythical kingdom where the King announces that whoever invents the most incredible thing will win the hand of the Princess in marriage and half of the Kingdom. What follows is creative, destructive but ultimately happy. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e826472c29c67786f4ef730bc756e40586d238e","amp;dn":"Pet+Shop+Boys+-+The+Most+Incredible+Thing+%5Bmp3-256-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e826472c29c67786f4ef730bc756e40586d238e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,130,100,114,194,156,103,120,111,78,247,48,188,117,110,64,88,109,35,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
