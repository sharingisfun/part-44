The articles from the First Edition were written more than 10 years ago and all areas of inorganic chemistry have seen such a vigorous development that it was necessary to update most articles and to add a considerable number of new articles. The result of this major work is the proud Encylopedia of Inorganic Chemistry Second Edition (EIC-2).\n\nNew Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now includes colour\n30% growth on previous edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now 6,640 pages, published in 10 volumes\nEIC-2 continues to present articles in alphabetical order, but the content has been slightly reorganized to the following subject areas: Main Group Elements; Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Bioinorganic Chemistry; Solid State, Materials, Nanomaterials and Catalysis; and General Inorganic Chemistry, Theoretical and Computational Methods.\nR.
