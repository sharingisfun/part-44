Eight More Miles To Louisville\n________________________________________\n\nCOUNTRY GUITAR THUNDER was originally released by Merle Travis and \nJoe Maphis in 1983. This is a repackaged version of that album, with \nbonus tracks and different cover art.\n\nMerle Travis recorded his portion of this album in association with \nveteran flat-picker Joe Maphis (maybe the fastest guitarist that ever \nlived) during 1977 and 1981 in Nashville, Tennessee, Albuquerque, New \nMexico, and Charlotte, North Carolina. It's an all-instrumental album \nmade up of duets and Maphis solo-featured numbers, and material ranging \nfrom traditional pieces like &quot;Irish Washerwoman,&quot; &quot;L'il Liza Jane,&quot; and \n&quot;John Henry&quot; to movie and television theme music (&quot;Ballad of Thunder Road,&quot; \n&quot;Bonanza&quot;). The sound is crisp and vivid, as well as surprisingly warm, \nand these guys knew how to make the stereo separation work for them. Six of \nthe 16 tracks are Maphis numbers, but the rest is a dazzling interweave of \nplaying by two of the greatest country guitarists that ever lived. And it's \nbudget priced, to boot.\n\nPerformers include: Joe Maphis, Merle Travis, Marty Stuart, David West, \nTom Corbett, Dennis Caplinger.\n\n\n\n-- Bruce Eder\n________________________________________\n\n\nRipped with : \n\nEAC 1.0b3\nSecure Mode\nTest &amp; Copy\nFlac 8\n\nAll artwork is also included \nin 600 dpi scans in PNG\n\n________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933f2103995fdb782681b8d9e6c29b7a3ea52ad3","amp;dn":"Merle+Travis+%26amp%3B+Joe+Maphis+-+Country+Guitar+Thunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933f2103995fdb782681b8d9e6c29b7a3ea52ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,63,33,3,153,95,219,120,38,129,184,217,230,194,155,122,62,165,42,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
