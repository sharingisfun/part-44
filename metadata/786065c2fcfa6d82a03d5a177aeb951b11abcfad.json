This Chinese silent film had a huge influence on Chinese cinema, and culture generally - you can easily see its influence on Stage Sisters (1965), a classic in its own right.\n\n&quot;Goddess&quot; is Shanghai slang for a kept woman. The story is a very realistic portrayal of a single mother driven to prostitution to support her young son. After much humiliation, she has to endure the worst - she is &quot;too degraded to be a good mother&quot;.\n\nAlthough it sounds as pathetic as D.W. Griffith's soap-operas, the gritty realism of the acting makes it something spaecial in silent cinema.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:786065c2fcfa6d82a03d5a177aeb951b11abcfad","amp;dn":"The+Goddess+%281934%29+Ruan+Ling-yu+%E7%A5%9E%E5%A5%B3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"786065c2fcfa6d82a03d5a177aeb951b11abcfad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,96,101,194,252,250,109,130,160,61,90,23,122,235,149,27,17,171,207,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
