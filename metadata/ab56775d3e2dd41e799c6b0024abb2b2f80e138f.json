This movie is related to Shakespeare's King Lear, only with sons\ninstead of daughters.\n\nThe other movies I was thinking about is Kurosawa's Kagemusha. That one refers to\nthe 16th century warlord Takeda Shingen, but refers to an attempt to substiture\na look-alike after the real guy dies. Maybe I will upload it later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab56775d3e2dd41e799c6b0024abb2b2f80e138f","amp;dn":"RAN+%281985%29+Japanese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab56775d3e2dd41e799c6b0024abb2b2f80e138f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,86,119,93,62,45,212,30,121,156,107,0,36,171,178,178,248,14,19,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
