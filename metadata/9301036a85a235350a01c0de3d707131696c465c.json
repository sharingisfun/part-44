But now our oddest nightmares are coming true - a new enemy is sending masses of invaders to infect our computers, palmtops, dish washers and even some of the coffee-percolators!\n\nThe only way to prepare for the final battle is to live abstinent (OK, this one isn't _that_ necessary), think fast, practice hard and - of course - use the appropriate training tool. Therefore, we at Cramon Utilities decided to create one of the best training devices ever designed, which (as a side effect) is also:\n\nThe Ultimate Arcade Game for OS/2 Warp.\n\nSo: Fasten your seat belts and blast your way through the hordes of mutant bugs, spiders and other nasty creatures in this original fast-paced galaga style arcade game. Dazzling graphics and explosive sounds meet you as you pilot your lonely ship trying to free the galaxy from Bills Evil BUGS!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9301036a85a235350a01c0de3d707131696c465c","amp;dn":"%5BOS2+-+eComStation%5D+Stardock+PlusPack+Bugs+-+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9301036a85a235350a01c0de3d707131696c465c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,1,3,106,133,162,53,53,10,1,192,222,61,112,113,49,105,108,70,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
