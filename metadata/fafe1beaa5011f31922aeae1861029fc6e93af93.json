Recently released from prison, Frankie is determined to set his life in order -- and that means divesting himself of his drug habit. He dreams of becoming a jazz drummer, but his greedy wife Zosch Machine (Eleanor Parker) wants him to continue his lucrative gambling activities.\nSince Zosch is confined to a wheelchair as a result of a car accident caused by Frankie, he's in no position to refuse. Only the audience knows that Zosch is not crippled, but is faking her invalid status to keep Frankie under her thumb.\nGambling boss Robert Strauss wants Frankie to deal at a high-stakes poker game; terrified that he's lost his touch, Frankie asks dope pusher Darren McGavin to supply him with narcotics. When McGavin discovers that Parker is not an invalid, she kills him, and Frankie (who is elsewhere at the time) is accused of the murder.\nHe is willing to go to the cops, but he doesn't want to show up with drugs in his system. So with the help of sympathetic B-girl Molly (Kim Novak), Frankie locks himself up and goes &quot;cold turkey&quot;-a still-harrowing sequence, despite the glut of &quot;doper&quot; films that followed in the wake of this picture. After Zosch herself is killed in a suicidal fall, the path is cleared for Frankie to pursue a clean new life with Molly.\n\nmore reviews: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Arm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Golden_Arm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048347/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048347/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fafe1beaa5011f31922aeae1861029fc6e93af93","amp;dn":"The+Man+with+the+Golden+Arm+x264+AAC+1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fafe1beaa5011f31922aeae1861029fc6e93af93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,254,27,234,165,1,31,49,146,42,234,225,134,16,41,252,110,147,175,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
