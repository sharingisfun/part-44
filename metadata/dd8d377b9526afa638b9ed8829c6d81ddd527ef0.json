But is this an accurate assessment, or historical propaganda,\n\nThe purpose of 'FDR: American Tyrant' is not to review FDR's economic failures and lies (though there were plenty), but rather to focus solely on the tyrannical actions of FDR's Presidency.\n\nMost of FDR's modern day conservative detractors are not even fully aware of just how heavy FDR's hand was. Liberals are often shocked when they hear the full extent of FDR's tyranny (though many will find some sick intellectual contortion in order to rationalize these deeds.)\n\nThis work presents, in chronological order, FDR's 16 worst acts of dictatorial tyranny.
