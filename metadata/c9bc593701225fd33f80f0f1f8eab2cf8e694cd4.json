The enormous amount of important research that went into this effort demands that all those who care about the well-being of IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people and healthy inter-community relations should read it carefully and weigh its conclusions fairly...\n\nThus far, we have heard the voices of those who, in condemning Modi, claim to speak on behalf of Gujarati Muslims. The value of KishwarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative is that she has let Muslims speak for themselves by quoting extensively from her video-recorded interviews with both rural and urban Muslims.\n\nAn honest understanding of this phase of contemporary history is vital for the health of democracy and amicable inter-community relations in India.\n\n\nForeword by Cho Ramaswamy, Editor, Tuglaq\n__\n\nThe manner in which the author has gone about talking to officials and people in detail, about the functioning of the Gujarat government under Modi; her visits to various parts of Gujarat to know about the conditions prevailing in the state; her unbiased and masterly analyses of the material she gathered through her tireless work, makes this book almost a thesis.\n\nBut unlike an academic thesis, the book makes absorbing reading; apart from being an irrefutable answer to the prejudiced critics of Modi, it is a page-turner too.    \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
