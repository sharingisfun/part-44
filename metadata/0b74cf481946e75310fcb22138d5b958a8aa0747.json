It is the third entry in the Arcana Heart series, following the events after Arcana Heart 2. The game went through location tests in Japan towards the end of 2009 and was officially released in December 2009. An official PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 release is then announced in Famitsu and stated to be released on January 13, 2011. A European release was announced by Zen United and PQube for June 30, 2011 along with a Limited Edition,[1] but was pushed back to August 19, 2011. The American release (PlayStation Network only) was released on April 19, 2011 by Aksys Games\n\n\nplot:\n\nThe game's setting takes place in a fictional, somewhat futuristic Japan combined with fantasy elements. In the previous game, Arcana Heart 2, a dimensional distortion occurred in the country's Kanto region, caused by the primordial being known as Angelia Avallone. This event came to be known as the &quot;Great Kanto Incident.&quot; The international Holy Spirit Institutions suffered harshly after the &quot;Great Kanto Incident,&quot; but restoration has begun and about two months have elapsed.\n\n\n\n\nIn this time, a family that had received technical assistance during the war in Europe created &quot;The Drexler Institution&quot; to resume its activities around the world. The Drexler Institution was hiding in Japan. Western Europe was devastated by the Office of the Holy Spirit led by Mildred who had since defected. The West Branch of the Holy Spirit Rosenberg Agency had to be completely reconstituted. Shortly thereafter, a large number of dimensional distortions were observed throughout Japan. &quot;Drexler&quot; was a little unusual and unnatural with its authority behind the scenes too. Japan embarked on a convergence of the Holy Office to gain control of the situation. They were looking closely into part of an area in Japan that educates several &quot;Maidens&quot;. This newcomer given the ability of a &quot;Maiden&quot; had begun her activities from the branch in Rosenberg. With the authority acquired from Drexler, a major order had been given to sink the entirety of Japan after six days.\n\n\n\ngameplay:\n\n\nArcana Heart 3 continues the series' usage of Arcana, or celestial beings based on the characters from the Tarot. In addition to the 23 playable characters, the 23 Arcana each have their own unique powers, to augment the abilities of the girls. The game adds a Force Gauge to the fight system. When completely filled, the Force Gauge allows the player to perform an Extend Force, a maneuver similar to the Arcana Burst from earlier games. The game also adds a &quot;Simple Mode&quot; which simplifies the control layout into a single button for each major function: one button for normal attacks, one button for special moves, one button for moves involving Arcana, and one button for the game's Homing Dash ability. The console version has a fully voiced story mode and HD anime graphics for super moves. It also includes the usual training mode, score attack, and online play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseed comment n enjoy...!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b74cf481946e75310fcb22138d5b958a8aa0747","amp;dn":"Arcana+Heart+3+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BXBOX360%5D%5Bsneak_shot%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b74cf481946e75310fcb22138d5b958a8aa0747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,116,207,72,25,70,231,83,16,252,178,33,56,213,185,88,168,170,7,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
