Gantmacher.\n\n \n The course of analytical mechanics is a foundation supporting such\n  divisions of theoretical physics as quantum mechanics, the special\n  and general theories of relativity, and so forth. For this reason, a\n  detailed presentation is given of variational principles and the\n  integral invariants of mechanics, canonical transformations, the\n  Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and systems with cyclic (ignorable)\n  coordinates (Chapters 2, 3, 4and 7). Following the ideas of Poincare\n  and Cartan, the author takes the integral invariants of mechanics as\n  the basis of presentation. Here they do not represent an\n  embellishment of the theory but its actual workaday machinery. The\n  technical applications are associated with a consideration of\n  constrained systems, which are studied in detail in Chapter 1. In a\n  special section of that chapter, which is devoted to\n  electromechanical analogies, the possibility is investigated of\n  extending the analytical methods of mechanics to electrical and\n  electromechanical systems. In Chapters 5 and 6 are given\n  applications of analytical mechanics to Lyapunov's theory of\n  stability and the theory of oscillations. Elements of modern\n  frequency methods are given along with the classical problems in the\n  theory of linear oscillations. Problems in the dynamics of rigid\n  bodies are taken up in individual examples. \n\n  Whom this text is for and what are the prerequisites?\n\n  It is assumed the reader is acquainted with the general fundamentals\n  of theoretical mechanics and higher mathematics. The text is\n  designed for undergraduate and graduate students of\n  mechanico-mathematical, physical and physical-engineering\n  departments of universities, and also for research engineers and\n  other specialists who feel a need to extend and deepen their\n  knowledge in the field of mechanics.\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky and\n  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1975.\n  \n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n\n  DJVU | 2.9 MB | OCR | Pages: 265 | Cover | \n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nContents\nPreface 7\n\nChapter 1\nThe Differential Equatlons Of Motion Of An Arbitrary System Of\n\nChapter 2.\nThe Equations Of Motion In A Potential Field 66\n\nChapter3.\nVariational Principles And Integral Invariants 88\n\nChapter4.\nCanonical Transformations And The Hamilton-Jacobi Equation 128\n\nChapter5.\nStability Of Equilibrium And The Motions Of A System 166\n\nChapter6.\nSmall Oscillations 202\n\nChapter7.\nSystems With Cyclic Coordinates 242\n\n\nReferences 259\nName Index 260\nSubject Index 261\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b24f956127bbb64435a5b5c8f371b37d8c735f","amp;dn":"Gantmacher+-+Lectures+in+Analytical+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b24f956127bbb64435a5b5c8f371b37d8c735f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,178,79,149,97,39,187,182,68,53,165,181,200,243,113,179,125,140,115,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
