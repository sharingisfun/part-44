Currently more than 100 different Macintosh hardware sensors and more than 200 hard drive temperature sensors\nare supported. The program can visualize the history graphs of the readings, display measured values in a large variety of fashions, or announce readings by speech output. It can also store and export readings. Depending on what sensors are built into your Macintosh system, the following data can be accessed:\n\nTemperarature readings at different locations\nBattery data of portable computers\nVoltage sensors\nCurrent (amperage) sensors\nFan speed sensors\nSensors for pulse-width controlled fans\nPower and load sensors\nAmbient light sensors\nUser-defined artificial sensors to monitor the operating system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f095ad553e5698419e0f750496a4e43055ecff86","amp;dn":"Hardware+Monitor+4.5+K%5C%27d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f095ad553e5698419e0f750496a4e43055ecff86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,149,173,85,62,86,152,65,158,15,117,4,150,164,228,48,85,236,255,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
