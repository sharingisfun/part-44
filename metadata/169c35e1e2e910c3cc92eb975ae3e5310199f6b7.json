Written by Robert Louis Stevenson; Full cast dramatisation starring David Rintoul, Tony Osoba, Nina Wadia and Peter Whitman; Dramatised by Donald Johnson.\n\nPoor Hawaiian native Keawe moves to San Francisco, where he acquires a bottle containing a wish-granting imp. But there is a catch: the bottle must be sold at a loss or else it will simply return to the owner. The bottle may not be thrown or given away, and if its owner dies without having sold it in the prescribed manner, their soul will burn for eternity in Hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:169c35e1e2e910c3cc92eb975ae3e5310199f6b7","amp;dn":"R.L.+Stevenson+-+The+Bottle+Imp+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"169c35e1e2e910c3cc92eb975ae3e5310199f6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,156,53,225,226,233,16,195,204,146,235,151,90,227,229,49,1,153,246,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
