Led by renowned conductor Craig Hella Johnson, Conspirare brings together outstanding vocal artistry and great music to inspire passion, sensitivity and playfulness. Conspirare combines the classics with contemporary works taking the audience on a journey of innovative sound, colorful images and thought- provoking literature. Formed in 1991 as The New Texas Festival, Conspirare began as an annual spring festival, and moved to a year round concert season in 1999. Today, Conspirare is set apart as one of a handful of professional choruses around the country bringing world-class performances to its listeners. An ensemble of professional singers from across the United States, Conspirare has garnered rave reviews, awards and national recognition for its refined artistry, \nvirtuosity, and expressive singing.\n\nCraig Hella Johnson has earned a reputation as one of the most respected choral/orchestral conductors in the nation. His performances are consistently praised for their musical integrity and depth of artistry. Johnson's conducting experience is uniquely varied. He is a leading interpreter of works for chorus and orchestra. He moves comfortably between the choral and orchestral mediums and his a cappella performances are known for their sensitivity and nuance. Johnson is the artistic director and founder of Conspirare, a national professional ensemble based in Austin. Since 1991, he has shaped a highly select group of musicians into a vibrant and dynamic ensemble. His performances and unique and innovative programming for Conspirare have drawn national attention. Following concerts during their summer residency in the San Francisco Bay Area, Robert Commanday praised the ensemble as &quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a distinctive new choral institution.&quot;\n\nIn addition to performances of the classical repertoire, Craig Hella Johnson has continued to explore the relationship and interconnectedness of various musical styles and to play at the boundary between classical and popular music and between sacred and secular music. Many have referred to this distinctive &quot;collage&quot; style as a compelling and provocative aspect of his concert programs. Johnson is also a songwriter, composer, arranger, pianist and singer. A native of Minnesota, Johnson studied at St. Olaf College, the Juilliard School, the University of Illinois, and Yale University. Under the auspices of a National Arts Fellowship, he was a student of Helmuth Rilling at the International Bach Academy in Stuttgart.\n\nConspirare's second studio recording, Requiem, was recorded at The Bank Music Hall in Troy, New York in October 2005, and the CD has already received rave reviews most recently the 2005 Margaret Hillis Award for Choral Excellence, presented by Chorus America. The album includes Howells' and Pizzetti's Requiems and some lovely, forlorn songs. Also a requiem from Austin's Eliza Gilkyson. &quot;This is simply gorgeous choral singingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦The Choir achieves near-perfect interpretive consensus and vocal enaemble, with stiletto-sharp intonation and unearthly tonal beautyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ American Rocoed Guide. &quot;Sublime. Conspirare's &quot;Requiem: We are so lightly here&quot; flies on the wings of perfection.\n\nfrom www.singers.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2d8c730c81fd391afbb4e191f6345058b3a485","amp;dn":"Conspirare+-+Requiem-+Howells%2C+Whitacre%2C+Pizzetti+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2d8c730c81fd391afbb4e191f6345058b3a485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,45,140,115,12,129,253,57,26,251,180,225,145,246,52,80,88,179,164,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
