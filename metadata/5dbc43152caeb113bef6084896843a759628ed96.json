The Futureheads \n\nand Field Music might have flown the flag the highest, attracting adoring \n\nglances from far-away fans, but just beneath the surface acts like This Ain't \n\nVegas have drawn favourable coverage, and splinter (super) group The \n\nWeek That Was delivered one of the best albums of 2008. Frankie &amp; The \n\nHeartstrings therefore have some pretty fertile soil to call home, hailing from \n\nSunderland (and, during their existence, sharing DNA with local legends \n\nKenickie) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but their modus operandi is fairly far removed from anything \n\npreviously proffered by their fellow townsfolk.\n\nThis five-piece might be worthy of here-and-now buzz, expected by many to \n\nfeature on the BBCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sound of 2011 list (they didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, though it shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \n\nharm their chances of mainstream recognition), but their sound harks back \n\nto another era of indie-pop. Indeed, they rewind the compositional clocks a \n\nwhole generation, with whispers of Orange Juice and Dexys Midnight \n\nRunners in the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical make-up. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the look, too. No \n\ngetting around it: Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t your usual cool kids on \n\nthe blogosphere block, threads and haircuts bearing distinct traces of the \n\n1950s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ front-fellow Frankie Francis (what a name there, chap) sporting a \n\nmarvellous James Dean quiff. It all serves to set the group apart from the \n\nseasonal slew of first-quarter contenders.\n\nBy standing out so prominently, Frankie et al will inevitably take their share \n\nof knocks. Accusations of style over substance, perhaps, from quarters \n\nunwilling to give debut album 'Hunger' the time it deserves. Well, let them \n\nhave their slings and their arrows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it means that these 10 ten tracks will be \n\nall the more adored by those whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve a space in their hearts for mellifluous \n\nmusic that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t trying to be big nor clever. By doing things their own way, \n\nreleasing a series of limited-run goodies via their own Pop Sex label, this \n\nband has steadily built a community committed to their cutesy, carefree \n\nanthems from a bygone pop period. And loyalty has been rewarded, as the \n\nsnappy riffs and taut percussion, with the mainmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s purring baritone, \n\ncombine to great effect.\n\nAt its best, tracks ingrain themselves immediately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the &quot;whoa-whoa&quot; joy of \n\n&quot;That Postcard&quot;, the album's brilliant celebration of standing up for oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \n\nfriends and ideals, and the meandering guitar-work underpinning vocals on \n\n&quot;Tender&quot; that climb away to dizzy heights. Even when tracks pass without too \n\nmuch of an impression left, the listener is never without a smile on their face \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simply that much fun on show. Unless, of course, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not \n\nprepared to allow a little northern charm to brighten their day. More fool, \n\nthem.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/18/frankie-the-heartstrings/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbc43152caeb113bef6084896843a759628ed96","amp;dn":"Frankie+%26+the+Heartstrings...Hunger%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbc43152caeb113bef6084896843a759628ed96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,188,67,21,44,174,177,19,190,246,8,72,150,132,58,117,150,40,237,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
