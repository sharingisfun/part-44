Born the third of six children in Chateauroux, 106 miles south of Paris, to a disillusioned mother and a father who was an illiterate sheet metal worker and alcoholic, Depardieu dropped out of school and ran away from home at the age of 12.\n\nHitchhiking around Europe, he earned money as a door-to-door soap salesman and as a beach boy in the South of France, as well as getting involved in car theft and the black market.\n\nAfter several brushes with the law and a brief spell in prison, things took a turn for the better when a friend encouraged the young Gerard to audition for the Theatre Nationale Populaire in Paris. Once he had overcome a stammer, Depardieu excelled, training alongside future co-stars Patrick Dewaere and Miou-Miou. In 1965, he made his film debut in the Ã¢â‚¬ËœLe Beatnik et le minetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, after which he quickly became a familiar face on French TV.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Depardieu had co-starred in 11 French films, but his big break was to come in 1974, when he was given the part of an incompetent thug in director Bertrand BlierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Les ValseusesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoing PlacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. After this success, he went on to star alongside popular French actress Isabelle Adjani in Ã¢â‚¬ËœBaroccoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, followed by the role of a passionate Communist agitator in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1900Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, before teaming up with Blier once again in the Oscar-winning Ã¢â‚¬ËœPreparez vos mouchoirsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœGet Out Your HandkerchiefsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nStarting the 1980s with a bang, Depardieu won FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prestigious CÃƒÂ©sar award for his portrayal of a resistance fighter in Ã¢â‚¬ËœLe Dernier mÃƒÂ©troÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Last MetroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. More rave reviews followed when he played the part of a 16-century peasant whose identity is in question in Ã¢â‚¬ËœLe Retour de Martin GuerreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Return of Martin GuerreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in 1982. The same year saw him shine in the title role of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDantonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, set in the aftermath of the French Revolution.\n\nDepardieu made the switch from actor to co-director in 1984, with Ã¢â‚¬ËœLe TartuffeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. A stellar performance as a tough cop in Ã¢â‚¬ËœPoliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ came next, snaring him the Best Male Performance award at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, before he landed the career-changing role of a naÃƒÂ¯ve farmer in the classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœJean de FloretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Suddenly, the name Gerard Depardieu was recognised around the world.\n\nThe actor sealed the approval of fans and critics alike in the title role of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCyrano de BergeracÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a box-office smash in 1990, for which he won a Best Actor Oscar nomination. The film, which scooped nine CÃƒÂ©sars, including DepardieuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Actor, and a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film, also earned him the 1990 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Male Performance.\n\n\n\nMaking the move into English-language acting, Depardieu starred alongside Andie MacDowell in the 1990 romantic comedy Ã¢â‚¬ËœGreen CardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, playing a French musician who agrees to a marriage of convenience. The following year he shared the role of 17th-century composer Marin Marais with his son Guillaume in the biopic Ã¢â‚¬ËœTous les matins du mondeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll The Mornings of the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Throughout the rest of the Nineties, Depardieu remained in high demand. Despite the limited success of an English remake of the 1991 hit Ã¢â‚¬ËœMon PÃƒÂ¨re, ce herosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, as Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy Father, The HeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and being miscast as Christopher Columbus in Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1492: Conquest of ParadiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, performances in the epic Ã¢â‚¬ËœGerminalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in Claude BerriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœColonel ChabertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in Ã¢â‚¬ËœLes MisÃƒÂ©rablesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBalzacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and a TV adaptation of Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Count of Monte CristoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, to name but a few, kept his legion of fans happy.\n\nAnother directing credit came in 1999, with the semi-autobiographical Ã¢â‚¬ËœUn Pont entre deux rivesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe BridgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and in the same year Depardieu took on the role of Obelix in the live-action remake of the comic books Ã¢â‚¬ËœAsterix et Obelix contre CesarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. This was followed, a year later, with a light-hearted portrayal of a flamboyant designer in the family film Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ102 DalmatiansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nHaving survived two near-fatal accidents (a plane collision in 1996 and a motorbike accident in 1998) and major heart surgery in July 2000, Depardieu went from strength to strength in the first few years of the new millennium, appearing in, among others, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove, Prozac and Other CuriositiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Roman CoppolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœCQÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBetween StrangersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, in which he acted opposite Sophia Loren, the Matt Dillon-directed Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of GhostsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBon VoyageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœTais-ToiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢/Ã¢â‚¬ËœShut UpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nDepardieu is divorced from Elisabeth Guignot, who he appeared alongside in Ã¢â‚¬ËœJean de FloretteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and who is the mother of his two grown-up children, Julie and Guillaume. He also has a daughter, Roxanne, reportedly born to model Karine Sylla. The actor has a famously rocky relationship with his son, officially cutting off contact with him in 2003 after Guillame threatened him with a gun, which led to a suspended jail sentence. Depardieu has had a long-standing relationship with the actress Carole Bouqet, with whom he opened the Parisian restaurant La Fontaine Gaillon in 2003.\n\nAs well as two restaurants, the actor maintains an eclectic mix of business interests, including a vineyard in the Loire, Romanian textiles businesses and Cuban oil wells. He has also written a cookbook and ventured into international politics. In 2005, at the age of 56, Depardieu announced his intention to retire from screen acting following his starring role in Ã¢â‚¬ËœMichou dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AuberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, claiming that he had nothing left to prove. He has since gone back on this decision, maintaining his prolific output with roles in several feature films, some of them still currently in production.\n\nFILMS INCLUDED IN PART TWO:\n\n\n1900 /\t\n36 /\t\nA Farewell to Fools /\t\nTHE origin /\t\nApproach And Reading From St. Augustine /\t\nAsterix At The Olympic Games /\t\nBaxter, Vera Baxter /\t\nBerenice /\t\nBetween Strangers /\t\nBimbo Land /\t\nBoudo /\t\nBye Bye Monkey /\t\nConcorrenza sleale /\t\nDie Frau Linkshandige /\t\nTell Him That I Love Him /\t\nDocumentaries /\t\nOn Location For A funny Meeting /\t\nDuex /\t\nExpulsion Of The Devil /\t\nI Machine /\t\nI Want To Go Home /\t\nThe inspector Barb /\t\nInspector Maigret /\t\nInspector Maigret Vol 4 /\t\nI More Nothing /\t\nI prefer to be Be Friends /\t\nI Love You /\t\nJean De Florette /\t\nL.Homme.Qui.Rit /\t\nThe Abbuffata /\t\nAbolition /\t\nL'Affaire Dominici /\t\nThe year 01 /\t\nThe Incorgo /\t\nLa Parola Amore Esiste /\t\nThe Life annuity /\t\nLa.Marque.Des.Anges.Miserere /\t\nThe Cri Du Cormoran /\t\nThe GarÃƒÂ§u /\t\nLe Grand Frere /\t\nThe Grand Restaurant /\t\nLe Grand Soir /\t\nThe best job in the world /\t\nSugar /\t\nTartuffe /\t\nKiller /\t\nThe Actuers /\t\nGuardian Angels /\t\nDogs /\t\nChildren Of Timbelbach /\t\nThe Gaspards /\t\nThe Accursed Kings /\t\nMichou D Auber /\t\nNiente.Puo.Fermarci /\t\nOle! /\t\nOne Hundred And One Nights /\t\nOur Man In Marseilles /\t\nPura Formalidad /\t\nRasputin /\t\nRene Cane /\t\nRiccardo Muti /\t\nRive Droite, Rive Gauche /\t\nRuy Blas /\t\nSan Antonio /\t\nOn September Deaths Ordinance /\t\nStreghe Verso Nord /\t\nRosy temporal /\t\nThe Envy Of Gods /\t\nThe Last Woman /\t\nTurf /\t\nTutto L'Amore Che This e /\t\nTV Series /\t\nUbojnaya Sila 5 /\t\nA Kiss Butterfly /\t\nA tidy sir /\t\nUna Vida Divertida /\t\nA woman or two /\t\nUranus /\t\nVincent, Francois, Paul And The Others /\t\nVolpone /\t\nXXL /\t\nGrenouille_d'hiver / \nFrank Etienne_vers_la_beatitude / \nla_femme_du_gange /\nle_cyborg_ou_le_voyage_vertical /\nl_inconnu /\nles_aventures_de_zadig /\nMirka /\nnot so wicked that ca /\npozdnjaja.ljubov /\nVse.mogut.koroli /\n\nI AM SEEING IF I CAN FIND MORE ENG SUBS FOR SOME OF THESE FILMS.
