It is simply stunning.\n\n[/font][/b]\n\nProbably the best known Zimbabwean guitar band, the Bhundu Boys broke the Harare sound to the UK and Europe in the mid 80s to much acclaim. Mixing Zimbabwean styles with rhumba influences from the Congo, the Bhundus labelled their fast-paced guitar music &quot;jit-jive&quot;. The band formed in 1980 under the leadership of lead singer Biggie Tembo who was a &quot;bhundu boy&quot; during Zimbabwe's liberation struggle; an underage runner for rebel soldiers. The Bhundu's eventually reached the top of the Zimbabwe music scene, scoring four number one hits (Baba Munini Francis, Wenhamo Haaneti, Hastisitose, and Ndimboze) between 1981 and 1984. This success brought the attention of DJs from the UK.\n\n[IMG]http://i571.photobucket.com/albums/ss156/muppetandchums/BhunduBoysFront.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i571.photobucket.com/albums/ss156/muppetandchums/BhunduBoysBack.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[b]see links[/b] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.embargo.ca/zim/artists/bios/bboys/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.embargo.ca/zim/artists/bios/bboys/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhundu_Boys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhundu_Boys&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bfaba9b172792bcd24d88cce7f9556100aca79f","amp;dn":"Bhundu+Boys+-+the+shed+sessions+-+2001+-+flac+-+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bfaba9b172792bcd24d88cce7f9556100aca79f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,250,186,155,23,39,146,188,210,77,136,204,231,249,85,97,0,172,167,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
