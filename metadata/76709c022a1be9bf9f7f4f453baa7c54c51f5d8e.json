The title refers to the surfing term &quot;point break&quot;. The film was a box office success upon its release and it has since gathered a cult following. Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), is a rookie FBI agent and former Ohio State quarterback who, with his partner, Angelo Pappas (Gary Busey), are investigating a string of bank robberies by a gang known as the Ex-Presidents. They are called this because they use masks of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson to disguise their true identities.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76709c022a1be9bf9f7f4f453baa7c54c51f5d8e","amp;dn":"Point+Break+%281991%29+COMPLETE+DVD+Rip+by+vladtepes3176","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76709c022a1be9bf9f7f4f453baa7c54c51f5d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,112,156,2,42,27,233,191,159,127,79,69,59,170,124,84,197,31,93,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
