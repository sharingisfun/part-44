WE NEED A SERIAL ASAP FOR THIS !! The free version can only process the first 5 clips in a sequence\n\n\n#### What is Crimson Workflow? #### \n\nOnline your 4K footage. Crimson WorkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ is a tool for transforming sequences created in popular Non-Linear Editing Software, such as Final Cut Pro, Avid and Premiere. It allows proxies, and offline material to be replaced by higher quality material, by efficiently managing the use of two software products distributed by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company, namely Redline and Redcine.\n\nCrimson WorkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ leverages many tools for troubleshooting less than perfect metadata and file structures giving the user tools to properly reconnect to original material. It also facilitates the use of Redcine after, rather than before editing a project.\n\n#### Who is Crimson Workflow for? #### \nCrimson WorkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ is targeted at smaller productions and individuals. But you might find it useful, no matter how large your production.\n\nCrimson WorkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ can be downloaded from this site. The free version can only process the first 5 clips in a sequence. Users can also purchase a serial number that removes the 5 clip restraint. \n\nCrimson WorkflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ currently works on Macintosh computers and supports XML sequences from Final Cut Pro. I am planning support for Avid and Adobe Premiere in the near future. I am also planning a Windows version that will be sold seperately.\n\n\n\nMore info @ http://www.crimsonworkflow.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa114fcf94d43c66cb08698046bab9cb2650d7e","amp;dn":"Crimson+Workflow+%28RED+Camera+Footage+transformer+for+FCP%29+v0.9.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa114fcf94d43c66cb08698046bab9cb2650d7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,161,20,252,249,77,67,198,108,176,134,152,4,107,171,156,178,101,13,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
