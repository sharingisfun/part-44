O Wind\n11. Semolina\n12. After The Ant Fight\n\nBristol based Rachael DaddÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feet pretty much only touch ground when she hits the stage. For the past two or so years she has been touring almost constantly; playing shows in England and further afield Japan, whilst in-between times; stitching craft things and painting personalised record sleeves for sale at gigs.\n\nAfter the Ant Fight (2009) is a collection of piano ballads and more heavily instrumented tracks with rootsy folk at their centre, all projected by a voice that seamlessly flits between a contemporary Regina Spektor and timeless Anne Briggs.\n\nWhile banjo is the dominate instrument on record there is an exceedingly varied use of drums, piano, trumpet, oboe, string arrangements ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ most of which are played by Dadd herself. She sites Sufjan Stevens as a favourite banjo player but being a female singer songwriter of the dust and dirt I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but liken her to Gillian Welch, though she is not necessarily as dark.\n\nThat said there is a certain fear for the natural world that underpins many tracks. Dadd herself stated in an interview with Spiral Earth that the technology and cars of the modern world ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œall seem really unnaturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to her and so her music is a form of escapism to simplicity. There is still a bouncy, witty quality to her song writing however and it is this carefree air that has the ability to raise the issues of mass production and our place on earth as a cog in a machine (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnt and BeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) in a way that never comes across as downtrodden observation, but more an inverse appreciation of the simpler things. This is also true of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œO WindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in which she rejects modernity and seems to ask the Earth for forgiveness, as she proclaims ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œand now youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re watching us undo ourselvesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nOne of the standout tracks on the album is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTwo SistersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a reworking of centuries old murder ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Twa SistersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Opening with just vocals and banjo it builds up to harmonies and delicate yet full instrumentation mirroring the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s progression by reaching its climax as the tragic tale reaches its pivotal point. Performed by Tom Waits, Okkervil River and Jim Moray in the past, Dadd lends a tenderness and empathy; with female harmonies and shifting perspectives; to this nightmarish folklore of a girl who drowns her sister over sexual jealousy.\n\nThe album as a whole offers bursts of energy, counteracting these with a staid poignancy, often within the same track. Channelling Joni Mitchell circa Blue on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUntil We Fall ApartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Dadd strips the track to its bones before proceeding to flesh it out over its duration. This is a familiar characteristic across much of the LP and we find ourselves chasing the songs as they dart back and forth: the artistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skill for both chopping and changing tempos as well as sifting instruments in and out of the mix highlighting her originality in marrying traditional folk with more contemporary song constructions.\n\nWith a song writing ability that shuns the confines of time and place Rachael Dadd offers us contemplation on modernity versus nature, the search for contentment in opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFollowing the GeeseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a condemned womanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Age of the ClockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and elementary yet endearing lyrics about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstepping on banana skinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsetting traps of needles and pinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nA timelessly unique voice, musician and song smith who, always being on tour, we really have no excuse not to investigate!\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/02/06/4534/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ac5625cafceb6ecfdd0a873b44d584e363bff4","amp;dn":"Rachael+Dadd...After+the+Ant+Fight%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ac5625cafceb6ecfdd0a873b44d584e363bff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,172,86,37,202,252,235,110,207,221,10,135,59,68,213,132,227,99,191,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
