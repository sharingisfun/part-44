Last season the Reds beat a dogged Hammers side 2-1 in an incident-packed match at Upton Park during the title run-in. Two Steven Gerrard penalties ultimately proved the difference in a game that saw the woodwork struck on numerous occasions. Arsenal are also on the road, they travel to Aston Villa and have not been beaten by the West Midlands club at Villa Park since 1998, winning eight of those 14 contests. Elsewhere, Mark Hughes takes his Stoke side to former club QPR and Tottenham host West Bromwich Albion.\n\nNo spoilers please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e69196a1f7a44c813fce38cdbfba0f3dca79114","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+-+20th+September+2014+-+HDTV+X264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e69196a1f7a44c813fce38cdbfba0f3dca79114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,105,25,106,31,122,68,200,19,252,227,140,219,251,160,243,220,167,145,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
