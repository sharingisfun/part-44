Its three songs were holdovers from the Wind &amp; Wuthering sessions, which the \nband felt did not fit the feel of the album. Upon its release, the EP managed to reach #14 in the UK singles charts. Although the EP market never took off in North America, their overseas distributor, Atlantic Records, released Spot The Pigeon in Canada. This was Genesis' final studio release before guitarist Steve Hackett's departure later in 1977. Unhappy that he wasn't able to get more of his songs onto Wind &amp; Wuthering, Hackett was further aggravated when &quot;Inside and Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which he felt was worthy of inclusion on the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was relegated to this EP. Although Spot the Pigeon saw a CD release, it has since been deleted. Two of its three tracks, &quot;Pigeons&quot; and &quot;Inside And Out&quot; appeared on the band's 2000 box set Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992, though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ due to their personal dislike of the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they saw fit to overlook &quot;Match Of The Day&quot;'s inclusion, making it a rarity for fans. However, the track had a new release on CD on May 15, 2007 when Genesis released the box set Genesis 1976-1982 in the US, thus making the entire EP available for the first time on CD in the US. &quot;Pigeons&quot; and &quot;Inside And Out&quot; have been also released on Turn It on Again: The Hits - The Tour Edition.\n\nA video for &quot;Match of the Day&quot; was made, with Phil Collins singing on the terraces of Queens Park Rangers F.C. This video is now believed to be lost. Phil himself \ndoes not even recall making a music video, but admits that his memory may be off.\n\nPlz seed and share to at least 1:1\n\nHappy Easter to you all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e871065b60403d861b05f7e0ca0680e7db2162d7","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+Spot+The+Pigeon+EP+320kbps+%7EDegsey%7E+%28re-seed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e871065b60403d861b05f7e0ca0680e7db2162d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,113,6,91,96,64,61,134,27,5,247,224,202,6,128,231,219,33,98,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
