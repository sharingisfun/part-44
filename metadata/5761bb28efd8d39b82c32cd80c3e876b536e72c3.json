Scenes set near Milford Haven were recorded on location in Wales, including on a Neolithic burial mound which served as Belarius's cave. \n\nThe cast also features Sian Phillips as the Queen, Nia Roberts as Imogen and William Houston (about to play Coriolanus for the RSC) as Posthumus. \n\nThe original music is composed by John Hardy, whose previous radio drama credits include In Parenthesis and The Sicilian Expedition for BBC Radio 3 and Under Milk Wood for BBC Radio 4. \n\nDuration:\n2 hours 30 minutes\n\nPlaylist:\nCymbeline ......
