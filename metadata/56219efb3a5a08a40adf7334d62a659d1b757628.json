After an early life of crime and seven years in prison, he changed his name to Malcolm X and changed the world with his fiery oratory centering on race and the Nation of Islam.  Here on two amazing CDs are the most dynamic and vibrant speeches Malcolm X gave before being felled by assassins in 1965.&quot;\n\n\nnote:  every effort was made (by me, ripping these CDs) to get the best balance of audio quality and bitrate and file size.  the audio quality of the original files are shitty, and i ripped these about four times before deciding on this bitrate (112 mono 32kHz).  the content of these speeches is HIGHLY inflammatory and, as such, HIGHLY recommended by me!\n\nimage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/1586/61hgl6zgbelaa240xt1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/1586/61hgl6zgbelaa240xt1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[img]http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/1586/61hgl6zgbelaa240xt1.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56219efb3a5a08a40adf7334d62a659d1b757628","amp;dn":"Malcolm+X+-+Wisdom+of+Malcolm+X+%5B1965%2Fmp3%2F112%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56219efb3a5a08a40adf7334d62a659d1b757628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,33,158,251,58,90,8,164,10,223,115,52,214,42,101,157,27,117,118,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
