Steve Leonard runs the gauntlet through air, land and sea to find them. \n\nA simple theme, an awesome tour-de-force. Ultimate Killers tells story of assassins and arsenals far scarier than you see in the movies. The series is presented by Steve Leonard (co-presenter of &quot;Vets in the Wild&quot; and &quot;Vets in Practice&quot;). Steve runs the gauntlet with the world's most deadly natural born killers, using six categories; speed, strength, toxicity, strategy, defence and capacity for man-eating. He and his crew travel the world in search of the deadliest animals - deadly in terms of their strength, speed, venom and pure killing ability. Steve swims with killer whales, stalks with lions, hunts out snakes, and dives with killer-jelly fish to let us experience, first-hand, the killers at work. In one episode, Steve meets an army major who happily offers arm to a scorpion and a centipede to judge which has the more painful bite. By the end of the series, Steve judges from a phalanx of lethal animals six he believes to be Ultimate Killers.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2073 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x408\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.765:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:07.960\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbc7244944a19f0abd1972fdd6923d58b682458","amp;dn":"BBC.Natural.History.Ultimate.Killers.1of3.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbc7244944a19f0abd1972fdd6923d58b682458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,188,114,68,148,74,25,240,171,209,151,47,221,105,35,213,139,104,36,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
