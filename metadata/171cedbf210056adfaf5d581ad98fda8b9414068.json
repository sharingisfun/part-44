Purporting to deal with a real-life 19th century diva 'whose popularity was such that over-exertion led to her death while singing,' the film is actually a grisly series of frozen or tortured tableaux (predominantly lesbian in implication) of heavily rouged, frequently ugly women who, pretending to sing heavy opera, go through contorted, icy attempts at communication that lead nowhere. The lip-sync is off; the singing is off-pitch; mouths are frequently open while no sound issues forth, or closed, with mellifluous arias or cheap popular songs heard on scratchy renditions of old records. Neither burlesque nor slapstick, the film's intent, at least in the beginning, is nevertheless ironical and subversive, though mysteriously so. However, it grows increasingly dark and more threatening, with screams, faces bathed in Vaseline, red, wet mouths, smeared eye shadows, and dehumanized figures. One cannot 'explain' Schroeter's work, other than recognize his debunking of opera as a metaphorical rejection of bourgeois society; but one trembles in recognition of a prospective major talent.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nDVDrip\n\nFilesize: 1,36 GB (1,399 MB, 1,433,408 KB)\nDuration: 1:44:12\nResolution: 592x448\nFramerate: 25 fps\nVideo codec: XviD ISO Mpeg 4\nVideo bitrate: 1679 kbps\nAudio codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio: 48000 Hz, 192 kbps\nNumber of audio channels: 2 (Stereo)\nNumber of audio tracks: 1\nBits-per-pixel ratio: 0.253 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:171cedbf210056adfaf5d581ad98fda8b9414068","amp;dn":"Der+Tod+der+Maria+Malibran+%28Werner+Schroeter+-+1972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"171cedbf210056adfaf5d581ad98fda8b9414068","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,28,237,191,33,0,86,173,250,245,213,129,173,152,253,168,185,65,64,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
