Books | ISBN: 1561719722 | 1997 | PDF | 409 pages | 38 Mb\n\n\nUsing the Freedom of Information Act to patiently outduel bureaucrats at Air Force and Navy Intelligence the CIA and the Department of State Stone obtained documents with minimally excised portions but with significant testimony from armed forces personnel still intact. they not only deal with major American UFO sites such as the alien crash site in Roswell NM but also major sightings that include hard evidence (such as unidentifiable metal fragments and chemical residues) in places like the Caribbean the Horn of Africa and the Himalayas. Beyond records of sightings and other fascinating reportage by armed forces personnel there is much evidence to prove that the government is covering up more information than it is reluctantly revealing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c8158119ee00d918ded19cab29ec4ecc039604f","amp;dn":"Ufos+Are+Real","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c8158119ee00d918ded19cab29ec4ecc039604f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,129,88,17,158,224,13,145,141,237,25,202,178,158,196,236,192,57,96,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
