This will be a story of mathematics in popular language so that the non-mathematician will see what it is all about. This is not a course in mathematics but merely a series of sketches concerning ideas and methods. There will be no proofs to carry out and no need for paper and pencil. What I want to do\nis sketch a picture of the development of mathematics and show what mathematicians are presently engaged inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to some extent. It is hardly possible to examine the whole field, but the fragments 1 hope to present will cover a rather wide range of outwardly unrelated mathematical theories and their applications. It is best to read one chapter after another as they occur in the book, since they are all linked together. If some parts are uninteresting, don't throw the book down. Go over the earlier chapters once again. I'm sure you will find something that will hold your attention.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Yakov Khurgin is professor of mathematics at the Chair of Applied Mathematics at the Gubkin Institute of the Petrolium and Gas Industry. He has written over a hundred scientific papers in pure and applied mathematics and has been particularly productive in the fields of radio-engineering, radiophysics, cybernetics, neurophysiology and psychiatry. At the present time (1984), Professor Khurgin heads the laboratory of applied mathematics. He is also a member of the USSR National Committee of Automatic Control.His extensive knowledge and wide range of activities have helped to make his popular science books a great success.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nA FEW WORDS WITH THE READER 9\nMathematician and physiologist get together in September 12\nMathematician and physiologist get together in December 20\nA radio engineer needs math 25\nOne last word to the reader 31\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MATHEMATICS? 33\nWhat is mathematics all about? 35\nA little historical background 36\n\nRUBBER-SHEET MATHEMATICS 41\nMathematics and art 47\nContinuous transformations 47\nA remarkable surface 55\nGraphs 58\n\nNUMBERS AND POINTS 71\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF A SADDLE 88\nExtrema 96\nExtremal curves 106\nThe epoch of Euler 108\nSoap bubbles 110\n\nMATHEMATICIANS ARE NOT ALL ALIKE 114\nWhere do axioms come from? 116\nTwo ways of reasoning 117\nInduction and mathematical induction 125\nThe drama of equation solvingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an historical sketch 129\n\nENGINEER CONSULTS MATHEMATICIAN 136\nWhat is better? 141\nCriteria 147\nOptimization 150\nHow close? 152\nMary and Maude 155\nIntegralsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not so terrible after all 157\nSpace, distance, norm 162\nTerms and where they come from 169\nThe problems of an oil engineer 172\nChoosing a job 174\nModel building 184\nMathematical models 187\nEvents and their models 191\nDoes one really need a mathematical model? 197\nModelling the oil-refining process 206\n\nYOU PROBABLY LIKE THIS BOOK 209\nProbability theory.

But finally I decided to go at it as this rare book, which I had purchased exactly 23 years back, was not available anywhere on the web. Its not a perfect scan but I hope its good enough!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53aa25427ce24e0f927ffb3db83f1c9c9f3176bf","amp;dn":"Did+You+Say+Mathematics%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53aa25427ce24e0f927ffb3db83f1c9c9f3176bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,170,37,66,124,226,78,15,146,127,251,61,184,63,28,156,159,49,118,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
