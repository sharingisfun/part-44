The supermodels featured in this video include Julie Newmar, Linda Evangelista, Tyra Banks, Beverly Peele, Nadja Auermann, Emma SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶berg, Rossy de Palma, and Estelle Hallyday.\n\nThe song was lyrically a basic, animalistic plea from Michael for sexual activity with an individual and musically it was the most upbeat record he had released since Faith almost five years previously.\n\nIt featured a clip from The Graduate. Anne Bancroft&amp;#039;s line of &quot;Would you like me to seduce you? Is that what you&amp;#039;re trying to tell me?&quot; was repeated during the final crescendo. The song then ended with a sample from the BBC sitcom Hancock&amp;#039;s Half Hour, with the line &quot;Will you stop playing with that radio of yours? I&amp;#039;m trying to get to sleep!&quot;.\n\n&quot;Too Funky&quot; reached #4 in the UK singles chart in 1992 and became that year&amp;#039;s most played record in Europe.\n\nIn the U.S. the single debuted at #84 on Billboard Hot 100, reaching #8, its peak position, by its fourth week, and had sold over 500,000, being certified Gold by the RIAA .\n\nIt is the biggest gainer song ever in the top fifty on the ARIA Charts jumped form #50 to #8 {42 places) and reached pick position #3 in Australia. &quot;Too Funky&quot; reached #3 on Dutch Top 40.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4753bbad3ef24fa2c47e8c976c475a844f3b0d4e","amp;dn":"George+Michael+-+Too+Funky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4753bbad3ef24fa2c47e8c976c475a844f3b0d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,83,187,173,62,242,79,162,196,126,140,151,108,71,90,132,79,59,13,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
