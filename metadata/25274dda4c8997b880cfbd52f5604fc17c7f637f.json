Returning to the show following their 2012 debut are US band Alabama Shakes, who have just released their second and well-received album Sound and Color, which sees them take more of deep-soul route, channelling the likes of Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. Southern-born, Brooklyn-based indie-country trio the Lone Bellow will be in the studio to perform a couple of tracks from their second album Then Came The Morning.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 1.48 GB\nRun-Time__: 30 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps 6186Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 CBR 2ch 48KHz 192Kbps\nAudio#2___: MP2 CBR 2ch 48KHz 256Kbps\nSubtitle#1: Teletext\nSubtitle#2: DVB Subtitle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25274dda4c8997b880cfbd52f5604fc17c7f637f","amp;dn":"BBC.Later.with.Jools.Holland.S46E04.Live.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25274dda4c8997b880cfbd52f5604fc17c7f637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,39,77,218,76,137,151,184,128,207,189,82,245,96,79,193,124,127,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
