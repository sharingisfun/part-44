While with Fantasy Records, Tjader usually spent his time cutting tough Latin jazz albums or releasing superb small-group, bop-tinged cool jazz sessions.  But under the guidance of Creed Taylor, most of Tjader's Verve sessions put a smooth gloss on his Latin style and almost completely ignored his very real talents for mainstream small-group jazz.  That doesn't mean that his Verve years weren't full of excellent music, because they were; it's just that he recorded less group music for Verve, so it's great to see that so much fine music shows up here.  Every track's a winner, but the CD features such highlights as Tjader's surprise pop hit &quot;Soul Sauce,&quot; a beautiful ballad reading of &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; the amazingly frenetic big band recording of the Horace Silver tune &quot;Tokyo Blues,&quot; and a hip-shaking version of &quot;Moanin'&quot; that has Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter sitting in.  Judging by this collection alone, you'd think Tjader's Verve period was the perfect marriage of high-quality jazz and mainstream commercial instincts.  If only &quot;selling out&quot; always sounded this good.  Maybe there's more to Cal Tjader's Verve sessions than there appeared to be at the time.  ~ Nick Dedina, All Music Guide \n\nThis Cal Tjader compilation is an amazing and very cohesive collection of well-played, well-arranged songs.  It's one of those rare cd's that everyone I play it for seems to like.  It's great to listen to and also is one of the best &quot;all-purpose, interesting background music&quot; cd's in my collection for various parties and get-togethers with friends.  \nOn the one hand there are the rich and varied latin jazz rhythms underpinning many of the numbers.  Then, there's a certain early '60's &quot;swinging bachelor pad&quot; air to the sophisticated, well-crafted, vibraphone-driven arrangements that support the songs without smothering them.  \n\nIf you like music like Miles Davis &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot;, Vince Guaraldi (the guy who did all the music on the &quot;Peanuts / Charlie Brown&quot; TV specials) and early Santana, then you will enjoy this Cal Tjader collection.  ~ &quot;bemaric&quot;\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 39 - Cal Tjader Tracks:\n01  Soul Sauce 2:26 \n02  Curacao 6:18 \n03  China Nights (Shina No Yoru) 3:32 \n04  The Whiffenpoof Song 2:05 \n05  Triste 4:12 \n06  Soul Bird (Tin Tin Deo) 2:41 \n07  The Way You Look Tonight 3:10 \n08  Daddy Wong Legs 3:43 \n09  Tokyo Blues 4:13 \n10  Cuchy Frito Man 2:22 \n11  The Prophet 4:35 \n12  Borneo 4:03 \n13  Leyte 5:22 \n14  Hip Vibrations 3:52 \n15  CalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bluedo 5:34 \n16  MoaninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 3:14 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d20016e536359ae81a1eac42e7dcdf2bcc6553c","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+39+-+Cal+Tjader+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d20016e536359ae81a1eac42e7dcdf2bcc6553c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,32,1,110,83,99,89,174,129,161,234,196,46,125,205,242,188,198,85,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
