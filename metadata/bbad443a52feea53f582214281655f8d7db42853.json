The sudden sound of sirens startles and excites them, but they don't :\n : have long to wonder what the sound could mean. Soon after seeing police    :\n : cars parked on their street, the boys learn the shocking truth: hours      :\n : before, Gene's father, Raymond Stoddard, walked calmly and purposefully    :\n : into the state capitol and shot to death a charismatic state senator.      :\n : Raymond then drove home and hanged himself in his garage.                  :\n :                                                                            :\n : The horrific murder and suicide leave the community reeling. Speculation   :\n : about Raymond's motives run rampant. Political scandal, workplace          :\n : corruption, financial ruin, adultery, and jealousy are all cited as        :\n : possible catalysts. But in the end, the truth behind the day's events died :\n : with those two men. And for Gene and his friend, the tragedy is a turning  :\n : point, both in their lives and in their friendship.                        :\n :                                                                            :\n : Nearly forty years later, Gene's friend, a writer, revisits the tragedy and:\n : tries to unravel the mystery behind one man's inexplicable actions. Through:\n : his own recollections and his fiction--sometimes impossible to separate--he:\n : attempts to make sense of a senseless act and, in the process, to examine  :\n : his youth, his friendship with Gene, and the love they both had for a      :\n : beautiful girl named Marie.                                                :\n :                                                                            :\n : Spare, haunting, lyrical, Sundown, Yellow Moon is a piercing study of love :\n : and betrayal, grief and desire, youth and remembrance. Using a brilliant,  :\n : evocative fiction-within-fiction structure, Larry Watson not only brings to:\n : life a distinct period in history but, most affectingly, reveals the       :\n : interplay of memory, secrets, and the passage of time.                     :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbad443a52feea53f582214281655f8d7db42853","amp;dn":"Larry+Watson+Sundown+Yellow+Moon+2008+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbad443a52feea53f582214281655f8d7db42853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,173,68,58,82,254,234,83,245,130,33,66,129,101,95,141,125,180,40,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
