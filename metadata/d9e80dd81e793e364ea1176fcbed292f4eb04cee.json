Since its inception, the trio has graduated from dive bars to the Grand Ole Opry, opening for Phil Vassar, Rodney Atkins, and Carrie Underwood along the way. The group signed with Capitol Nashville in 2007 and released its first single, &quot;Love Don't Live Here,&quot; which peaked at number three on the country charts. A self-titled debut album followed in April 2008, featuring production from Victoria Shaw and Paul Worley and stocked with more country hits (including the chart-topping single &quot;I Run to You,&quot; which also enjoyed crossover success as a Top 40 pop hit). \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\tFLAC Lossless\nContains:\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nLady Antebellum (2008)\n\nNeed You Now (2010)\n\nOwn The Night (2011)\n\nOn This Winter's Night (2012)\n\nGolden (2013)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9e80dd81e793e364ea1176fcbed292f4eb04cee","amp;dn":"Lady+Antebellum+-+Discography+2008-2013+%5BFLAC%5D+mindcrasher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9e80dd81e793e364ea1176fcbed292f4eb04cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,232,13,216,30,121,62,54,78,161,23,111,203,237,41,47,78,176,76,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
