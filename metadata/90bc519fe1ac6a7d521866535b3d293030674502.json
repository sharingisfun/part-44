In 2008, He found his love for Punk/Pop/Screamo and formed a widely known local band consisting of those genres. In 2012 (at age 25 and writing/performing every Instrument and Vocal), dEnNy333Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s determination to be creative and pursue what he loves is stronger than ever by combining elements of Hip Hop, Screamo and Punk Rock . Ã¢â‚¬Å“My music is written entirely from real emotion that a wide audience can relate to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He says. After a hard break-up (unfaithfulness), dEnNy333 focused even harder on music and released his first single titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Hate You TooÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. After receiving multiple messages from people stating the song had helped them in getting back onto their feet (due to similar hardships), dEnNy333 released another single titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fuck YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fuck You is a track that people can very much relate to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“At some point in life people are talked about negatively in attempt to bring them down physically and mentally.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“This track is an anthem for all of us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ With plans of releasing his debut EP later this year; titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not For The Faint Of HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, dEnNy333 hopes to finally gain the success that he deserves.\n\nFor Fans Of: Hollywood Undead, Deuce, So Sick Social Club, Metal, Punk and Screamo.\n\nBe Sure to Join the Army!
