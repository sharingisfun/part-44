It includes songs from and inspired by the movie Young Guns II. Emilio Estevez asked for Bon Jovi's &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; as the theme song for his upcoming Billy the Kid sequel, but Jon Bon Jovi ended up composing an all new theme song for the film's soundtrack instead. \n\nThe album featured guests such as Elton John, Little Richard, and Jeff Beck. Blaze of Glory was awarded a Golden Globe. It also received Academy Award and Grammy nominations.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n\n    Billy Get Your Guns          - 4:49\n    Miracle                      - 5:09\n    Blaze of Glory               - 5:40\n    Blood Money                  - 2:34\n    Santa Fe                     - 5:41\n    Justice in the Barrel        - 6:49\n    Never Say Die                - 4:54\n    You Really Got Me Now        - 2:24\n    Bang a Drum                  - 4:36\n    Dyin' Ain't Much of a Livin' - 4:46\n    Guano City                   - 1:00\n\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd9facd677b2960cc26bd7c1e7bf5d145ec7cd75","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+1990+-+Blaze+Of+Glory+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd9facd677b2960cc26bd7c1e7bf5d145ec7cd75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,159,172,214,119,178,150,12,194,107,215,193,231,191,93,20,94,199,205,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
