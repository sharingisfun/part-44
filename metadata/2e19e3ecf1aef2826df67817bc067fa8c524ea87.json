According to Hard Rock Haven review, &quot;the perennially underrated Mick Box delivers some first-rate guitar work here, and with each new album Bernie Shaw is becoming the definitive voice of Uriah Heep&quot;. According to Alan Holloway of Rock United Reviews, who rated the album a 7 out of 10, &quot;despite a few niggles, however, this is a great album that should not be missed by anyone who has enjoyed Heep live or on record in the past.&quot;\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks are written by Mick Box and Phil Lanzon, unless noted otherwise.\n\n    &quot;Nail on the Head&quot; - 4:15\n    &quot;I Can See You&quot; - 4:13\n    &quot;Into the Wild&quot; - 4:20\n    &quot;Money Talk&quot; (Phil Lanzon) - 4:44\n    &quot;I'm Ready&quot; - 4:14\n    &quot;Trail of Diamonds&quot; - 6:28\n    &quot;Southern Star&quot; (Phil Lanzon) - 4:26\n    &quot;Believe&quot; - 5:09\n    &quot;Lost&quot; (Trevor Bolder) - 4:51\n    &quot;T-bird Angel&quot; - 4:01\n    &quot;Kiss of Freedom&quot; (Phil Lanzon) - 6:13\n    &quot;Hard Way to Learn&quot; (Trevor Bolder) - 5:25 (Japanese edition bonus track)\n\nCredits\n\n    Trevor Bolder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, vocals (lead on track 9)\n    Mick Box Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, vocals\n    Russell Gilbrook Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, vocals\n    Phil Lanzon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals\n    Bernie Shaw Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\nI find these and post em and they always have about the same amount of hits so here is some Heep please download responsibly: That means Seed.
