This series brings you a potent mix of romance and deep passion, leaving you wanting for more as you get deeper into the lives of the characters, Walter and Emily.\n\nEmily OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hara has always been overshadowed by her glamorous and demanding step-sister Kristen, and that is never more true than on KirstenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding day. When Emily meets the kind and ruggedly sexy groom, Walter, she can only dream that he might be interested in her. But when Kristen cruelly fails to walk down the aisle of her own wedding, WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart is broken, and Emily finally sees the chance to make him understand KristenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true character. Walter takes Emily for one night of steamy passion, and she thinks all her dreams have come true. But is WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love for Emily going to give her all the passion she's ever dreamed of? Or is he simply using her in the aftermath of his broken wedding?\n\nThis series is a contemporary romance featuring searing and graphic depictions of romantic activity.\n\nAmazon Digital Services, Inc. | English | June 26, 2014 | ASIN: B00LBQVX7Q | 41 pages | azw, epub, lrf, mobi | 1 mb\n\nBiography\n&quot;There was a naughty girl\nAnd a naughty girl was she,\nFor nothing would she do\nBut scribble poetry&quot;\n\nKatelyn Skye began her creative career very young, writing little romantic poems that she was too afraid to show to anybody. After graduating from high school and getting admitted into college, her poems slowly developed into longer verses and eventually into little stories that she finally allowed others to read.\n\nThey eventually matured, as she did, to romances filled with the wildest fancies of her imagination. As her own sex life flourished, so did the lives of her characters and her stories became edgier, more alive than ever before.\n\nKatelyn Skye endeavors to give her readers the most modern and contemporary romance tales for women. She writes strong, independent female characters who either learn to, or are not afraid to experience all that life has to give.\n\nShe hopes you enjoy reading her work as much as she has always enjoyed writing it.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nKatelyn Skye\n\nxoxo\n\nContact me at:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564bab960dcdbb7ae271b316fbafcf1d684270a1","amp;dn":"%5BKatelyn_Skye%5DLove+Affair%28azw%2C+epub%2C+lrf%2C+mobi+%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564bab960dcdbb7ae271b316fbafcf1d684270a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,75,171,150,13,205,187,122,226,113,179,22,251,175,207,29,104,66,112,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
