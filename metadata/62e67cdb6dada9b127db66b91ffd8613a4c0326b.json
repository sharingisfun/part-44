Converted with PSX2PSP from NTSC region disk. This copy will not have the black bars accross the top and bottom of the screen in fullscreen mode. That issue is common with PAL games being played on a NTSC console. Any pre-existing savedata will still be usable with this version.\n\nFor custom firmware PSPs only, and requires popsloader to play. With your PSP hooked to a computer, navigate to your memory stick's PSP/GAME folder and copy and paste the Digimon World folder.\n\nTested on M33-6 and latest popsloader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62e67cdb6dada9b127db66b91ffd8613a4c0326b","amp;dn":"%28PSP-PSX%29+Digimon+World+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62e67cdb6dada9b127db66b91ffd8613a4c0326b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,230,124,219,109,173,169,177,39,219,102,185,31,253,134,19,164,192,50,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
