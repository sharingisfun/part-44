It's on two levels. I see 'home' as being internal and external. It's kind of a play on words. Definitely part of the song is about the shallowness of success and getting caught up in a world and success and chasing, being popular, or whatever, is taking 'the long way home'. Because I think 'home' in its deepest sense is inside, is being at peace with oneself. Again it's ambiguous - 'if you're not around' meansÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you're dead or you couldn't settle down - you couldn't take it and you're off looking for things that are more important. It's a fun song! I remember having a lot of fun writing it but never really having a clear picture of it. It was moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ often when I write songs, I go by gut instinct... the best lines come to me rather than me trying to think them up consciously and I just feel they're right and I go with them whether I totally understand the meaning or not.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Roger Hodgson, In the Studio with Redbeard for the making of Breakfast in America ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44e315682fd61adf9c50881e525acf662f12016","amp;dn":"Supertramp+-+Roger+Hodgson+-+In+The+Studio+With+Redbeard+Intervi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44e315682fd61adf9c50881e525acf662f12016","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,78,49,86,130,253,97,173,249,197,8,129,229,37,172,246,98,241,32,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
