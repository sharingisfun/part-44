But these young lovers are newly turned vampires trying to fight the bloodsucking urge inside them. To make matters worse, they've got a pack of angry vampires on their tails -- plus bad-ass vamp-killer Travis Kidd. He's tracking the &quot;Heartbreak Killers&quot; across the heartland, but can he stop them before it all ends in tragedy?
