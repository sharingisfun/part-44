The movie, which captures the original band lineup in the middle of the legendary 1973 Billion Dollar Babies tour, has never before been available on home video or DVD.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shout! Factory is proud to present the original cut of the film (including skits featuring the band) which was given a very limited theatrical runÃ¢â‚¬â€mostly at midnight screeningsÃ¢â‚¬â€in the mid-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s. This is the early cut, predating the Hollywood version. Now available for the first time since the theatrical release, Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper boasts a new high-definition film transfer as well as a new Surround Sound mix created from the 16-track master tapes, plus a multitude of extras, including movie-length commentary by Alice himself. &quot;The film that out-grosses them all&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€as it was originally billedÃ¢â‚¬â€is back, looking and sounding better than ever.\n\n1.Hello, Hooray\n2.Billion Dollar Babies\n3.Elected\n4.I'm Eighteen\n5.Raped And Freezin'\n6.No More Mr. Nice Guy\n7.My Stars\n8.Unfinished Sweet\n9.Sick Things\n10.Dead Babies\n11.I Love The Dead\n12.School's Out\n13.Under My Wheels\n14.And a studio performance of The Lady Is A Tramp\nÃâ€˜ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½:\nAudio Commentary by Alice Cooper\nAnamorphic Widescreen &amp; 5.1 Surround Sound\n&quot;Play concert only&quot; viewing option\nUnfinished Sweet (Uncensored Edit) (480p, 3:57)\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer (480p, 3:15)\nPoster Gallery with Original Promotional Material (480p, 2:57)\nDeleted Scene and Outtakes (480p, 2:00)\nBand Biographies\nDVD Easter Eggs\n\n\n\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ°Ã‘â€¡ÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂ¾: Blu-ray\nÃÅ¡ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ¹ÃÂ½ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬: BDMV\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: VC-1\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ ÃÂºÃÂ¾ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂº: DTS, PCM\nÃâ€™ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ¾: VC-1 17951 kbps 1920*1080p / 23,976 fps / 16:9 / Advanced Profile 3\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾#1: English DTS-HD MA 5.1 / 48 kHz / 4704 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾#2: English LPCM Audio / 2.0 / 48 kHz / 2304 kbps / 24-bit\nÃï¿½Ã‘Æ’ÃÂ´ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾#3: English LPCM Audio / 2.0 / 48 kHz / 2304 kbps / 24-bit (Commentary by Alice Cooper)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2174679b85382ee38a0c21c447876f401b509484","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper+Good+to+See+You+Again+Bluray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2174679b85382ee38a0c21c447876f401b509484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,116,103,155,133,56,46,227,138,12,33,196,71,135,111,64,27,80,148,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
