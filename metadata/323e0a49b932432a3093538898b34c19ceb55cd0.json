From the high-octane to the genteel, the contestants then meet Shura at Mosman Bowling Club for a game of lawn bowls, Mole style of course! The competition is getting down to the wire and tonight, one contestant's luck will run out.\n\n\nIf you'd really like to know who the final 3 are (and spoiling it for yourself), internet search 'mole final 3'.  Or, there are people like LeonDavis23 who are just moles anyway.\n\nPlease SEED like the wind, as this 56k modem is burning rubber!\n\nEnjoy and feel free to comment or say thanks :)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323e0a49b932432a3093538898b34c19ceb55cd0","amp;dn":"The.Mole.AU.S06E19.PDTV.x264-nogrp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323e0a49b932432a3093538898b34c19ceb55cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,62,10,73,185,50,67,42,48,147,83,136,152,179,76,25,206,181,92,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
