R. Martin [ONLY]\nAs published in Dangerous Women \n\n.epub and .mobi files\n\nThe Princess and the Queen is a novella consisting of material written by George R.R. Martin for The World of Ice and Fire but cut when it ran drastically over-length. Rather than lose the material, Martin decided to publish it in his anthology Dangerous Women. \n\nThe Princess and the Queen is a narrative history, taking place at the outbreak of the Dance of Dragons.\n\n--\n\nI removed GRRM's novella from the collection, created a new cover, and reworked the ePub in Sigil. The .mobi file was convered using Calibre.\n\nEnjoy.
