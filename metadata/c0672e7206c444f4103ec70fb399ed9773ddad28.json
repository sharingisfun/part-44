As Nan takes on a number of menial jobs, eventually operating a restaurant with Pingping, he struggles to adapt to the American way of life and to hold his family together, even as he pines for a woman he loved and lost in his youth. Ha Jin's prodigious talents are in full force as he brilliantly brings to life the struggles and successes of the contemporary immigrant experience.\n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nSince emigrating from China to America in the 1980s to study literature, Ha Jin has become one of the most celebrated voices in American literature. A Free Life is his first &quot;American&quot; book, a &quot;Chekhovian portrait of life and its soothing dailiness&quot; (Vikram Johri) that explores the meaning of a truly free life. Critics often comment on the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyricism and the fluidity of his prose (interestingly, one reviewer notes a connection between Jin and John Steinbeck, while another noted a deficiency in prose). Although rarely plot-driven, Jin's novels instead unfold slowly &quot;like life itself. A Free Life offers the greatest reward to those who read with patience and in quiet contemplation, absorbing the author's passion for language.\nC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0672e7206c444f4103ec70fb399ed9773ddad28","amp;dn":"Ha+Jin+-+A+Free+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0672e7206c444f4103ec70fb399ed9773ddad28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,103,46,114,6,196,68,244,16,62,199,15,179,153,237,151,115,221,173,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
