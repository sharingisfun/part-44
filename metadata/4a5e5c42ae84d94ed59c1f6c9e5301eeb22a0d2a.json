In feudal Japan they were ronin. In the US post-Civil War, they were desperadoes or hired guns. In the chaotic times of the collapse of human civilization, they are men, women, and aliens without shelter or succour. When no one else will take a stand, they stand for themselves. They are deserters, murderers, pirates, and worse; they are the Renegades.\n\nRenegades: Origins contains the novellas Deserter's Redemption, The Gentle One, Declaration, Ghost Story, and A Murder of Crowes. It also contains six short stories: &quot;Research Notes&quot;, &quot;Runner&quot;, &quot;Fool's Gold&quot;, &quot;System Failure&quot;, &quot;Dishonored&quot;, and &quot;Crossed Stars&quot;.\n\nDeserter's Redemption (The Renegades #1)\n\nMike doesn't want to be anyone's friend. He doesn't want to be a leader. He sure doesn't want to be a hero. He's tried all of that before; it didn't work out then and he knows it wouldn't work out now.\n\nHe doesn't have a choice.\n\nCaught by an invading alien race and shipped off to a prison station as (expendable) labor, Mike will have to become all of those things in order to escape. More, he'll have to turn a band of misfits into a group that can not only survive... but escape from a place where survival is measured in hours. In the doing, he may have to do the one thing he knows will get him killed: learn how to trust.\n\nThe Gentle One (The Renegades #2)\n\nAriadne has built her life around being a good person. She thinks positive, she tries to help people, and she never gets angry. The last is especially important, because Ariadne is a psychic, and bad things can happen if a psychic loses control of her emotions.\n\nThe problem is, Ariadne and her friends are on the run from an expansionist alien race. As an escapee from a prison station, she's been marked for death, and the only way out of the star system is to hijack a ship. With limited supplies, powerful enemies, and companions whose trustworthiness is questionable, her enemies seem almost assured of victory. Ariadne is going to have to do the one thing she's sworn never to do again...\n\nDeclaration (The Renegades #3)\n\nPixel is an engineer on the run from his own past. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand people and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focused on the things he can understand: machinery, mathematics, and design. Now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the run from the alien Chxor, after he and his new friends escaped from a prison station, hijacked a ship, and managed to sabotage a lot of Chxor orbital infrastructure in the process. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re far beyond safe human space and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had to work together to survive.\n\nPixel has come to trust the mismatched group of humans and aliens that have become his friends. The thing is, they want to select a leader, a Captain for their crew. Pixel knows it is a bad ideaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and worse, it looks like blood is about to be spilled over who might become the Captain.\n\nIt shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be PixelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job to solve it. He fixes problems with machinesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ not those of friendship, trust and leadership. But he knows if he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something, this election might well turn into a bloodbath. Worse yet, as it calls up echoes of his past, Pixel wonders not only if he can intervene, but if he can do so in a way that will not make things worse.\n\nGhost Story (The Renegades #4)\n\nEric Striker is a man on the run with a past that haunts him, which has led him to his current rag-tag companions. They've escaped from the xenocidal alien Chxor, hijacked a ship, are headed for human space, and they've even selected a captain for their motley crew. Yet on the edge of human space, the margin of survival is as thin as the blade of a razor.\n\nWhen they encounter a ghost ship, the crew awakens a threat. Something awaits them, something that preys upon ships and crews as they ply the void. It will test the fragile alliances of the crew to the breaking point and beyond. Eric will have to bury the ghosts of his past to face that danger... or his past will bury him.\n\nA Murder of Crowes (The Renegades #5)\n\nAmong the rag-tag crew of outlaws and escapees, Simon has a unique background: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cop. So when one of the crew winds up dead, naturally the others turn to him to find out the identity of the killer. It should be a quick investigation aboard the tiny ship with a small crewÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Except that in this case, everyone is a suspect. Simon has to wonder, not who is guilty, but who, on this ship, is really innocent.\n\nRead by Scott Birney\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5e5c42ae84d94ed59c1f6c9e5301eeb22a0d2a","amp;dn":"Kal+Spriggs+-+Renegades%3A+Origins+%28The+Renegades+%231-5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5e5c42ae84d94ed59c1f6c9e5301eeb22a0d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,94,92,66,174,132,217,78,213,156,31,108,158,83,1,238,178,42,13,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
