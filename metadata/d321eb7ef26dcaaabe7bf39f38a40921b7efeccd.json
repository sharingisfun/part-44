They mix elements of epic post rock, \npost metal and modern d beat hardcore - taking influence from bands such as \nNeurosis, Remains of the Day, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, His Hero Is Gone, etc. \n\nThe name refers to an element from the book Watership Down, in which Efrafa \nis a fascist state ruled over by a dictatorship. The band uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;efrafa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; to \nrepresent the reign of man over this planet, Owsla (the name of the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s debut album) \nrepresenting the natural world. The band is a concept project, based not only around \nthe watership down mythos, but also on their strong atheist/vegan principles. \n\nThey plan to release a trilogy of records known collectively as \n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Warren of Snares\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;: Owsla(guardian), Elil (enemy), and lastly Inle (death). \nThe latest installment is Elil, a three song, 65 minute album.\nThe band have received a lot of praise for their music, both for the concept surrounding \nthe band and the music itself, although fans of their first record \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;owsla\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \n(which was a typical modern crust sound) have sometimes not appreciated the bands move \nto a more progressive less obvious\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;crust\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; sound. The band are still staunchly political \nand diy, but with the advent of their second album, began to incorporate lengthy post rock \nand avante garde metal passages. Although they have completed various tours and shows,\nThey rarely play live, spending most of their time writing and recording.\n\nwww.fallofefrafa.com  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d321eb7ef26dcaaabe7bf39f38a40921b7efeccd","amp;dn":"Fall+of+Efrafa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d321eb7ef26dcaaabe7bf39f38a40921b7efeccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,33,235,126,242,109,202,170,190,123,243,159,56,164,9,33,183,239,236,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
