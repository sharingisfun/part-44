A trimmed-down version was released by Artanis Entertainment, but this is the only set that contains the full, nearly 104 minute show.  Currently available as part of a CD/DVD combo Live and Swingin', this pair of CD's is nonetheless an important document of the Rat Pack in action.  First off, if you've never heard a show by the Rat Pack, then it's an experience where you leave feeling like you had to be there.  Some of the jokes are purely physical, so that the laughs of the audience and the stars are incomprehensible to the listener.  Also, the humor is \nvery topical, from Sinatra: &quot;Shut up, Sam, and sit in the back of the bus!&quot; Davis: &quot;Jewish people don't sit in the back of the bus!&quot; Sinatra: &quot;Jewish people own the bus!&quot; - to Dean's trademark drunken humor, much of the time the audience is laughing only because they're drunk themselves. Nevertheless, the affection that these three friends have for one another is palpable, and even if the skits aren't as off-the-cuff as they seem, it still sounds like they're having a great time. Vocally, Sammy comes off the best, with burn-down-the-house renditions of &quot;What Kind Of Fool Am I?&quot; and &quot;Birth Of The Blues&quot; - Frank on the other hand, seems much more casual in his numbers, almost throwing away songs like &quot;Goody Goody&quot; and &quot;Please Be Kind.&quot;\n\nDisc One\n\nDean Martin\n1.
