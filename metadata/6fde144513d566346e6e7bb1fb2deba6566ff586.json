In particular, it focuses on the occurrence of an 'armed attack' - the crucial trigger for the activation of this right. In light of the developments since 9/11, the author analyses relevant physical and verbal customary practice, ranging from the 1974 Definition of Aggression to recent incidents such as the 2001 US intervention in Afghanistan and the 2006 Israeli intervention in Lebanon. The notion of 'armed attack' is examined from a threefold perspective. What acts can be regarded as an 'armed attack'? When can an 'armed attack' be considered to take place? And from whom must an 'armed attack' emanate? By way of conclusion, the different findings are brought together in a draft 'Definition of Armed Attack'.\n\n\n\nFile Size: 3442 KB\nPrint Length: 617 pages\nPage Numbers Source ISBN: 0521766648\nSimultaneous Device Usage: Up to 4 simultaneous devices, per publisher limits\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (January 1, 2010)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Charter-Cambridge-International-Comparative-ebook/dp/B004P1JFKG/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Charter-Cambridge-International-Comparative-ebook/dp/B004P1JFKG/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: UN, United Nations, international law, international, war, war of aggression, conflict studies, defense, just war, jus ad bellum, jus in bello, self-defense, responsibility to protect, r2p, political science, IR, leveraging, hedging, NATO, ROK, DPRK, Police action, UNSC, security council, p5, p2, p3, laws of war, warfare, extrajudicial, legal system, legal, law, justice, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fde144513d566346e6e7bb1fb2deba6566ff586","amp;dn":"Armed+Attack%27+and+Article+51+of+the+UN+Charter+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fde144513d566346e6e7bb1fb2deba6566ff586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,222,20,69,19,213,102,52,110,110,123,177,251,45,235,166,86,111,245,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
