When the doors swing      \n    open, a huge dump truck begins dumping 16,000 items of pre-loved     \n     clothing in a huge pile. Their challenge is to create high-end      \n     chic day wear, using only what's in front of them, sending some     \n     designers into a spin. As Alex says &quot;One man's trash is another     \n      man's treasure&quot; and the designers must pass their bags to the      \n    person on their right, causing Matcho to fall to his knees! Some     \n   of the designers struggle to work with each other's materials, and    \n     when the models come in for their fitting, three designers have     \n    nothing for them to try on. And if the designers weren't nervous     \n   enough, when they get to the Runway Megan drops a bombshell - this    \n   week will be a double elimination! Terry Biviano joins the judging    \n   panel to help decide who will be safe and which two designers will    \n                                 be out.                                 \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n            &lt;a href=&quot;
