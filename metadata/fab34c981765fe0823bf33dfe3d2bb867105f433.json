He plays an unsuccessful Royal Navy officer, and six of his maritime ancestors. This was the last film Guinness made for Ealing Studios. By coincidence, his first Ealing success was Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), in which he also played multiple roles.[2] The film was written by T. E. B. Clarke, the screenwriter of Kind Hearts and Coronets.[\n\nm4v\n720x576\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle_Bill_%281957_film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle_Bill_%281957_film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050168/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050168/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWilliam Horatio Ambrose (Guinness) wants desperately to live up to the proud family tradition; the Ambroses have always been mariners, hence their family motto, Omnes per Mare (All at Sea). In humorous vignettes, Guinness portrays all six, starting with a confused caveman pioneer and ending with his own father's ignominious demise at the Battle of Jutland. Ambrose has a debilitating problem however: he gets violently seasick at the slightest excuse. As a result, his contribution to the Second World War consists of testing cures for the malady.\n\nWhen he retires from the Royal Navy as a captain, he purchases a dilapidated amusement pier (the closest thing to a command of his own) with his life savings. The workers are an apathetic bunch, led by an insolent Figg (Victor Maddern), who quits as soon as the new owner begins imposing some semblance of discipline. With the assistance of his new second in command, Tommy (Percy Herbert), and much hard work, Ambrose soon has the pier repaired.\n\nThen he has to deal with the local town council, headed by the crooked Mayor Crowley (Maurice Denham) and the hostile Arabella Barrington (Irene Browne), who mistakes him for a peeping tom when they first meet. Every time he comes up with an ingenious way to make his business profitable, they see to it that the council outlaws it. When Crowley decides to confiscate and demolish Ambrose's pier and Barrington's bathing huts (under compulsory purchase) to further his own business interests, she resigns from the council and informs Ambrose. He counters by registering his property as a &quot;foreign&quot; naval vessel (christened the Arabella), under the flag of the easygoing country of Liberama, which puts it outside the town's jurisdiction. He soon attracts many happy, paying passengers for his stationary inaugural &quot;cruise&quot;.\n\nThwarted, Crowley hires Figg to take his dredger and demolish the structure late at night. Using a seasickness remedy suggested by Barrington, Ambrose is able to take to sea and foil the scheme (with his ghostly ancestors watching approvingly), but in the process, part of the pier becomes detached and floats away. He remains aboard to prevent salvagers from claiming it and drifts over to France, where he is hailed as a great naval hero.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab34c981765fe0823bf33dfe3d2bb867105f433","amp;dn":"Barnacle+Bill+%281957%29+with+Alec+Guiness+%28aka+All+At+Sea%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab34c981765fe0823bf33dfe3d2bb867105f433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,179,76,152,23,101,254,8,35,191,51,223,227,210,187,134,113,5,244,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
