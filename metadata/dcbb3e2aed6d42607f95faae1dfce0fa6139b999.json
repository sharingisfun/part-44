There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall -- think of it, always.'' -- Gandhi \n\nA holy man to Hindus, a hero to Muslims, and a criminal to the British, Mohandas K. Gandhi was an inspiring figure of the twentieth century, a man whose quest to live in accord with God's highest truth led him to initiate massive campaigns against racism, violence, and colonialism. \n\nFrom his youthful rebellion against vegetarianism, to his successful law practice in South Africa, his struggle with his own sexual excesses, and his leadership of the movement to free India from British rule, Gandhi describes the story of his life as a series of spiritual ''experiments'' and explains how he developed his concept of active nonviolent resistance, which propelled the Indian struggle for independence and inspired countless other nonviolent struggles. \n\n(Translated from the original in Gujarati by Mahadev Desai.)\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; MP3CD Unabridged edition (June 1, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441749926\nISBN-13: 978-1441749925\n\nNarrator - Bill Wallace \nBitrate - 128kbps\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
