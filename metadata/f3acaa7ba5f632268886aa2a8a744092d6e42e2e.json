Tears Fall Down collects all their best and adds a scattering of good album cuts. The original albums will still hold some delights after this, but they won't be required listening. If you want more Tears for Fears, check out their strong, though underappreciated, later work like 1996's Saturnine Martial &amp;amp; Lunatic. --Gavin McNett","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3acaa7ba5f632268886aa2a8a744092d6e42e2e","amp;dn":"Tears+for+Fears+-+Tears+Roll+Down+Greatest+Hits+82-92","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3acaa7ba5f632268886aa2a8a744092d6e42e2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,172,170,123,165,246,50,38,136,134,170,42,138,116,64,146,214,228,46,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
