Incensed at the rebellion displayed by southern warlords Liu Bei (You Yong) and Sun Quan (Chang Chen), Emperor Xian (Wang Ning) grants his trusted General Cao Cao permission to crush their outspoken opponents. But the journey south isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t easy for Emperor XianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s massive military, and before long the soldiers are struggling with lack of water and sheer exhaustion. Meanwhile, Zhou YuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s army draws a line in the sand and prepares to defend it with their lives. When typhoid breaks out among Cao CaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s troops, the quick-thinking strategist successfully infects ZhouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s army with the disease as well, causing the later to realize that psychological warfare has finally come into play. Subsequently deserted by Liu Bei, Zhou prepares to lead an army of approximately 30,000 men against Cao CaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s massive force of several hundred thousand. The battle drawing near, Zhuge Liang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) resorts to some clever tactics in order to undermine Cao Cao, and undercover princess Sun Shangxiang (Vicki Zhao) delivers secret messages from the Cao CaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s camp. As violence erupts on the Yangtze River, Zhou YuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife (Lin Chi-ling) emerges to play an unexpectedly crucial role in the historical proceedings.\n\nRatings: IMDB: 7.4/10.0 (2,639 votes) | RT: 100%\nGenre: Action, Drama, History, War\nDirected by: John Woo\nStarring: Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Fengyi Zhang, Chen Chang, Wei Zhao\nLanguage: Mandarin\nFirst Cinematic Release: 8 January 2009 (China)\n\nRelease Name: Red.Cliff.II.2009.1080p.BluRay.DTS.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€264-D-Z0N3\nVideo: x264 @ 2.35:1 A/R (1920ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€816) WxH 24,000 FPS\nAudio: 1536 kb/s 6 channels DTS Chinese\nSubtitles: English | Dutch; Flemish\nSize: 12,3 GB (avg bitrate of ~ 10,9 Mbps)\nRuntime: Release ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ n/a | Official ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 142 mins\nFilename: Red.Cliff.II.2009.1080p.BluRay.DTS.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€264-D-Z0N3.mkv\n\nScreenshots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/majepaacf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/majepaacf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326972/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326972/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_cliff_ii/reviews_users.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/red_cliff_ii/reviews_users.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d68a127f2a2d2cac651f15c816af3632d5e86ad3","amp;dn":"Red+Cliff+II+2009+1080p+BluRay+DTS+x264-D-Z0N3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d68a127f2a2d2cac651f15c816af3632d5e86ad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,138,18,127,42,45,44,172,101,31,21,200,22,175,54,50,213,232,106,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
