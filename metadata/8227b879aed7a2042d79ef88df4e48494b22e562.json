Hill\n\nThis has always been one of my favorite Anthrax albums even though it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get as much praise as their older releases. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a big fan of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spreading the DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Among the LivingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ myself, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“State of EuphoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has some excellent music on it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a perfect medium between Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the album they did after Ã¢â‚¬Å“EuphoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Persistence of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ epitomized mid-80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s thrash with its fast, swinging style, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“EuphoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brought Anthrax into more refined territory. And even though Ã¢â‚¬Å“EuphoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is not quite as speedy as Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the music and vocals are superb. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never tire of songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Be All, End AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out of Sight, Out of MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DarkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Misery Loves CompanyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, all tracks with the just the right mix of speed, riffing, and melodic sensibility. I also think this album and Ã¢â‚¬Å“PersistenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are the two best vocal performances of Joey BelladonnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. He had mastered the range between aggressive metal singing and that soaring falsetto that was nearly out of control at times on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Spreading the DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Among the LivingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. If you want to hear one of the best examples of quality late-80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s thrash, give Ã¢â‚¬Å“State of EuphoriaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a spin. Anthrax was on top of their game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnthrax - State of Euphoria\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Anthrax\nAlbum................: State of Euphoria\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
