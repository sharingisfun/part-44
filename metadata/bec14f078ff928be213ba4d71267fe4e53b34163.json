Their lyrics, on non-instrumental songs, mix English and Japanese worlds, oftentimes extraordinarily exemplify: difficult to decipher. The members of the band met in high school and formed the group in 1995. They began performing in earnest in 2000, and their first major release, Indy-Ann, remained in the CRJ-tokyo charts for seven weeks.\n\nThe albums: \n- Indy-Ann (2003/12/04)\n  *260 kbps\n\n- Ben (2004/08/18) \n  *192 kbps\n\n- Uncle John (2005/06/22)\n  *320 kbps\n\n- Idol (2006/06/07) \n  *160 kbps\n\n- Good Morning (2006/11/22) \n  *128 kbps\n\n- Star (2007/05/23) \n  *192 kbps\n\n- Quest (2008/02/06) \n  *192 kbps\n\n- PB (2009/04/01) \n  *320 kbps\n\n- The Guide (2010/10/06) \n  *320 kbps\n\n- Special Others (2011/11/30) \n  *320 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec14f078ff928be213ba4d71267fe4e53b34163","amp;dn":"Special+Others+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec14f078ff928be213ba4d71267fe4e53b34163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,193,79,7,143,249,40,190,33,59,164,215,18,103,254,78,83,179,65,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
