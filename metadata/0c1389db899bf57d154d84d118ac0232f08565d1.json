The lyrics are sung in the first person of an individual who is outraged by police brutality and decides to take the law into his own hands by killing violent, corrupt police officers. The song, which lyricist Ice T referred to as a &quot;protest record,&quot;[1] was written in 1990, and was partially influenced by &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; by the Talking Heads.[2]\n\nThe song provoked much controversy and negative reactions from politicians such as George H.W. Bush,[3] Dan Quayle[3] and Tipper Gore,[4] although some defended the song on the basis of the band&amp;#039;s First Amendment rights. When Ice T began to feel that the controversy over the song had eclipsed the band&amp;#039;s musical merit, he chose to have the album briefly discontinued before it was re-released without the inclusion of the song.[1] The studio version of the song is currently unavailable in any official format.\n\n-wiki, wrong about that last line, eh?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c1389db899bf57d154d84d118ac0232f08565d1","amp;dn":"Cop+Killer+%28song%29+%5BIce+T%5D+%5BBody+Count%5D+%5BOMERTA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c1389db899bf57d154d84d118ac0232f08565d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,19,137,219,137,155,245,125,21,77,132,209,24,172,2,50,240,133,101,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
