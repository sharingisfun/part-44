A blues gumbo repertoire that can conjure up the ghosts of highway 61 &amp; the delta blues experience. Austin &quot;Walkin' Cane&quot; is a blues singer, songwriter and slide guitarist that performs acoustic solo, duo &amp; electric band sets. Walkin' Cane has traveled all over the world from New Orleans, Louisiana to the Gold Coast of Australia and has acquired various blues/instrumentalist awards over the years. Austin walked for ten years with a cane due to an arterial venous malformation at birth. While performing on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a homeless man called out &quot;Hey Walkin' Cane got some spare change for a brother?!&quot; Austin took the jibe as his nickname.

In 2002, Austin &amp; Karen Starks were married at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee and began recording his 706 Union Ave. cd at the legendary studio immediately after the ceremony. &quot;The thought of getting married &amp; recording in the same room where many of my heroes took their first steps was incredible.&quot;\n\n\nMmmm...not bad...  \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074c6ee1a4c82d58cc17378bcbc9fe0db33dfe03","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Austin+Walkin%5C%27++Cane+-+Murder+Of+A+Blues+Singer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074c6ee1a4c82d58cc17378bcbc9fe0db33dfe03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,76,110,225,164,200,45,88,204,23,55,139,203,201,254,13,179,61,254,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
