Sandra Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a newspaper columnist obliged to enter rehabilitation for alcoholism. The film costars Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth Perkins, Steve Buscemi and Diane Ladd.\n\nGwen Cummings borrows the limo at her sister's wedding after ruining the reception with her drunken antics. She crashes the limo while she is on her cell phone trying to find a cake to replace the one she destroyed. She is given a choice between jail or 28 days in a rehab center. She chooses rehab. However, she is extremely resistant to taking part in any of the treatment programs they have to offer, refusing to admit that she is an alcoholic.\n\nAfter getting to know some of the other patients, Gwen gradually begins to re-examine her life and see that she does, in fact, have a serious problem. Her sincere desire to get well complicates her relationship with long-time, live-in boyfriend Jasper. She befriends Andrea, a 17-year-old recovering heroin addict who occasionally harms herself. All of the other patients help her see herself in a different light while she tries to get sober and come to terms with her alcoholism. The path to recovery will not be easy and success will not be guaranteed or even likely, but she is now willing to give it a try.\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84a336c55a525ad17a740a24126469b242c9dfae","amp;dn":"28+Tage+%282000%29+DVD9+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84a336c55a525ad17a740a24126469b242c9dfae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,163,54,197,90,82,90,209,122,116,10,36,18,100,105,178,66,201,223,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
