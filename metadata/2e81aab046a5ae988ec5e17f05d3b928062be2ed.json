She spins her life story of love, lessons learned, conflict and resolution throughout the mixtape. The EP elegantly unites the classic soul of yesterday with the hip sounds of today's R&amp;B and Pop. It features RioVille, Memphis' own Don Trip, StarLito (Formerly All-Star), and has production from Key Wane, RioVille, and Ducko McFli. Star Murphy gives the fans her real name &quot;Kourtney Murphy&quot; to give them a more personal feel about her journey to Egypt\n\n1.Trip To Egypt Intro \n2.Familiar (prod.
