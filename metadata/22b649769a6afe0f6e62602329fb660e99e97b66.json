Dinah changed and evolved as a singer thru the years (some critics accuse her for &quot;selling out&quot; to pop) and her voice grew rich and soulful as well.  There's the early Dinah from the mid to late 40s with songs such as &quot;Long John Blues&quot; &quot;Slick Chick on Mellow Side&quot; where she's only backed by a trio and guitar.  Record company did a good job restoring sound quality on the earlier recordings.  You can hear Dinah's voice mature thru the years.  As the years go by you can hear the different accompanists - orchestra, strings and violins - it all shows how comfortable Dinah was in each and every musical setting.  The later pop smashes are here too &quot;What A Difference A Day Makes&quot; &quot;This Bitter Earth&quot; &quot;Unforgettable&quot;.  She truly was unique and versatile.  No wonder she boasted to the public &quot;I can sing anything, anything at all. &quot; She wasn't boasting at all.  Sound quality is very good to excellent. ~ Peter\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 19 - Dinah Washington \n01 - A Slick Chick (On The Mellow Side) 2:43 \n02 - What A DiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢rence A Day Made 2:31 \n03 - Please Send Me Someone To Love 3:07 \n04 - This CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Be Love 6:52 \n05 - New Blowtop Blues 2:39 \n06 - Cold Cold Heart 3:22 \n07 - This Bitter Earth 2:29 \n08 - A Foggy Day 8:03 \n09 - Darn That Dream 5:18 \n10 - You DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know What Love Is 4:05 \n11 - Pennies From Heaven 2:19 \n12 - Long John Blues 3:14 \n13 - Our Love Is Here To Stay 3:11 \n14 - Squeeze Me 2:13 \n15 - Baby (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got What It Takes) 2:47 \n16 - Unforgettable 2:41 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b649769a6afe0f6e62602329fb660e99e97b66","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+19+-+Dinah+Washington+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b649769a6afe0f6e62602329fb660e99e97b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,182,73,118,154,106,254,15,110,98,96,35,41,251,102,14,153,233,123,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
