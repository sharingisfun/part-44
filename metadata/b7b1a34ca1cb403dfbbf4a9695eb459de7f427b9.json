At first the object is believed to be an unexploded bomb dropped on the city by \nthe Germans during WWII. Upon further examination what has been discovered is an alien spacecraft and the remains of its occupants.  In time, conclusions drawn \nfrom these events lead scientists to shocking conclusions about the origins of the human race.
