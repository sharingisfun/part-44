With Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing at their best.\n\nThis is not my rip, I found it on the net using PirateBay's tracker, so I thought it should be represented here.\n\nWidescreen, good stereo.\nXvid 720x304.\nBurn tested, runs well in my divX player.\n\nStrange coincidence: The novel 'Catcher in the Rye' frequently referred to was an inspiration for the man who shot John Lennon of the Beatles. It's full of fuck-talk and sex.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933c45a1380e80156037cddce794b0271f30d74d","amp;dn":"Six+Degrees+of+Separation+%281993%29+Will+Smith+-+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933c45a1380e80156037cddce794b0271f30d74d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,60,69,161,56,14,128,21,96,55,205,220,231,148,176,39,31,48,215,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
