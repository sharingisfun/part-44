Tete Montoliu spent most of his career recording for various European-based record labels, with some of his best works appearing on Steeplechase. Such as this duo live session with bassist Niels Pedersen. Montoliu chose his collaborator well, because he responds wonderfully to an aggressive pianist like Tete, providing strong support and lively interplay without stepping on him. The program is dominated by standards, (no originals this time) all of them well developed between 9 and 11 minutes each.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - There'll Never Be Another You\n02 - I Love You\n03 - I Fall In Love Too Easily\n04 - Lover Man &amp; Salt Peanuts\n\nEnjoy and share!
