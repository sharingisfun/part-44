This didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean, however, that they only worked on secondary lines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they could occasionally be seen hauling prestige expresses when more powerful locomotives were not available.\nManor Class locomotives were a perfect mixed-traffic design and were as happy hauling a coal train as they were a seven-coach stopping train. Although not a hugely powerful design, the locomotives were well liked and indeed 29 of the 30 built made it to 1964/5 (virtually the end of UK steam operations) which undoubtedly helped nine members of the class make it into preservation.\n\nIn their early years the 7800 Class locoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s could be found across much of the GWR system, but by the end of the 1950s virtually all operations were concentrated in South or Mid Wales, where steam power hung on for a little longer than on the main lines.\n\nBy the time the Manors came into service the beautiful fully lined GWR livery was no more, but Lydham Manor carried this non-authentic livery in preservation and is presented in this pack in that form.\n\nInitially the Manors were not great steamers but over time modifications produced an exceedingly good design, one of those modifications was the chimney style that is included on the models in this pack\n\nLIVERIES\n \nThe GWR Manor locomotive is supplied here in three liveries:\n\nBR Lined Green\nBR Lined Black \nGWR Lined Green (7827)\nThis expansion also includes tenders with both the early and the late style emblems.\n\n\nLOCOMOTIVES\n7812 Erlestoke Manor, BR Lined Green, 3,500 gallon late emblem tender\n7821 Ditcheat Manor, BR Lined Black, 3,500 gallon early emblem tende\n7823 Hook Norton Manor, BR Lined Green, 3,500 gallon early emblem tender\n7827 Lydham Manor, GWR Fully Lined Green, 3,500 gallon tender\n7828 Odney Manor, BR Lined Green, compatible with 7812 and 7823 tenders\n\nCOACHES\n\nJust Trains Mk1 coaches complete with passenger view in the following liveries:\n\nBrown and Cream - British Railways\nBrown and Cream - Great Western Railway\nCrimson and Cream Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blood and CustardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ British Railways\nIncludes Ã¢â‚¬ËœCornish RivieraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ destination boards.\n\n\nSCENARIOS \n \nPlease note that the scenarios included with this Manor Class add-on will only work on the assigned routes, some of which are not supplied with Train Simulator 2013 and will need to be purchased.\n\nSomerset Joint Railway - Somerset and Dorset route\n\nBad Manors\nA Manor has failed in the platform at Templecombe Lower whilst hauling a rail tour to Bristol.

These three models can be used with either tender depending on the required period.\n\nThis pack is also designed to allow owners to create their own versions of the Manor as the models do not include names and numbers as part of the main mesh; these are added as 'child' objects that can be replaced. The inclusion of the BR Green and BR Black liveries from the GWR Manor Class package are included for this reason.\n\nThese distinctive and classic engines are supplied in a set of liveries and come with nine custom scenarios including a Free Roam and also includes tenders with both the early and the late style emblems.\n \n\nCOACHES \n\nThis Add-on Pack uses the Just Trains Mk1 coaches supplied with GWR Manor Class in these liveries:\n \nBrown and Cream - British Railways\nBrown and Cream - Great Western Railway\n\nNINE SCENARIOS\n \nPlease note that these scenarios will only work on the assigned routes, some of which are not supplied with Train Simulator 2013 and will need to be purchased.\n\nSomerset and Dorset route\n\nMidsomer Tripper\nDrive a GWR Manor on a couple of early morning trip workings around Midsomer Norton and Radstock in 1948.\n\nMixing It Up\nDrive a GWR Manor on a mixed parcels/freight service from Evercreech down to Radstock.
