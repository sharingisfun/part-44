You'll see how amazingly powerful applications can be built using Backbone. Each series shows the natural progression, refactoring, and testing of real-world applications.\n\n\nWho are these screencasts for?\n\nAnyone interested in building single page applications using Backbone. Developers of all skill levels can benefit. Concepts start slowly and build on piece by piece.\n\n\nWhat's covered?\n\nEach application has different features, but we'll cover topics such as code architecture, patterns and conventions for organizing files, CRUD actions, user authentication, dialogs, animations, and much more.\n\n\nWhat languages / tools are used?\n\nThe central topic will be Backbone JS and other frameworks, plugins, and tools to use with Backbone. The backend is Ruby on Rails, but you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be an expert in it to get started. All client side code is written in Coffeescript","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0105982c402e92e9e436513e651ccf35d00af83f","amp;dn":"Backbone+Rails+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0105982c402e92e9e436513e651ccf35d00af83f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,5,152,44,64,46,146,233,228,54,81,62,101,28,207,53,208,10,248,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
