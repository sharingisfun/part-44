The lineup of this particular quintet, which represented Britain at the 1969 Montreux Jazz Festival, is truly stellar: in addition to Skidmore there's Canadian trumpeter/flÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼gelhorn virtuoso Kenny Wheeler, pianist John Taylor, bassist Harry Miller, and percussionist Tony Oxley. Two of the six tracks are credited to John Surman, and one, the sultry &quot;Old San Juan,&quot; is penned by John Warren, Surman's collaborator on Tales of the Algonquin, another classic release from the same year. If the Surman material reveals the discreet influence of the late-'60s Miles Davis quintet, Oxley's &quot;Majaera&quot; begins to explore the more dangerous territory of free playing he would return to the following year on his Four Compositions for Sextet. Elsewhere, John Taylor's &quot;The Yolk&quot; is a boisterous, brilliant piece of hard bop, and the last three tracks, segued together as a suite, explore a similarly wide range of styles. So much so that Skidmore aficionados tend to prefer the greater coherence of the following year's septet release on Philips, TCB, but Once Upon a Time remains one of the landmark albums of British jazz. ~ Dan Warburton\nTracklist\n01 - Once Upon a Time 07:00\n02 - Majaera 03:56\n03 - The Yolk 05:51\n04 - Old San Juan  11:48\n05 - Free for Al  04:30\n06 - Image  04:56\n\n\nPersonnel: Alan Skidmore (tenor saxophone); Harry Miller (acoustic bass); Kenny Wheeler (flugelhorn); John Taylor (piano); Tony Oxley (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7c5b8af250a10991e0c859aafba0a9188c6c1e","amp;dn":"Alan+Skidmore+Quintet+Once+Upon+A+Time+%28jazz%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7c5b8af250a10991e0c859aafba0a9188c6c1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,124,91,138,242,80,161,9,145,224,200,89,170,251,160,169,24,140,108,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
