You can hear the song streaming here at chriscornell.com or on Chris's social networking sites at MySpace, Facebook, and Imeem. \n\nOne of Rory's carers had this to say about the song:\n&quot;I have the greatest honor of spending every day with the lyricist of this new song. What you all do not know is just how deep this song actually goes and the basis behind it's importance. I have been given permission from Rory to speak about his situation. Rory lost his 6 year old daughter, Ainslee to Cancer this past April. After having to endure such a tragic loss, Rory, himself was diagnosed with non-operable Cancer just 4 months later. When Rory became my patient and more importantly my friend, I asked him what his final wish would be. He expressed the need to tell Chris Cornell how much his music impacted his life and of the bond it helped create for him and his daughter...often times Chris' music is what made Ainslee smile throughout her battle with cancer. This goes way BEYOND a fan making a song with an artist. Chris has truly opened his heart for Rory...something he never had to do. For everything that is missing for Rory, Chris has played a major part in filling the holes... as there are many. Chris Cornell is truly an angel on this earth...and nothing makes me more happy than to see Rory smile. I now find myself day-dreaming of the day when I get to witness Rory hug his hero...whenever that will be. So please as you listen to this song..know that this was written in a Daddy's anquish....say a prayer for Rory, his wife Connie and their son, Zavier. And Chris...from me to you....my cup runeth over...you are a rare breed and thank you for loving my friend.&quot;\n\nRead Rory's lyrics below:\n\nI Promise It's Not Goodbye \n\nMommy, please don't cry\nI'm as safe as I can be\nI know you miss me so\nBut I've finally been set free\nIf you find that you need me \nI'll be waiting right here\nTo help you get through\nAnd take away all your fear\nI love you so much mom\nBut it's time for me to fly\nI'll visit you every night\nI promise it's not goodbye \nBubba, please don't cry\nI'm still your best friend\nWe will always be together\nThere'll never be an end\nI hope you don't forget\nThe games we loved to play\nKeep me in your heart\nAnd forever I will stay\nI love you so much brother\nBut it's time for me to fly\nI'll visit you every night\nI promise it's not goodbye \nDaddy, please don't cry\nI am still here everyday\nIt may not be the same\nBut beside you I still lay\nWhen you think of me tonight\nHold me tight in your mind \nIf you ever again need me\nI won't be hard to find\nI love you so much daddy\nBut it's time for me to fly\nI'll visit you every night\nI promise it's not goodbye ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04eafaee797b9753376b9114ccfd3e4b5c432b2","amp;dn":"I+Promise+It%5C%27s+Not+Goodbye","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04eafaee797b9753376b9114ccfd3e4b5c432b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,78,175,174,231,151,185,117,51,118,185,17,76,207,211,228,181,196,50,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
