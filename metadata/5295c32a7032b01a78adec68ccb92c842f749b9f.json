Release: 1991 - 320Kbps\n\n\nListeners charmed by his pre-El Paso country have a motherlode to explore in this five-disc boxed set filled with dewy-eyed weepers (his earliest recordings), his rockabilly (he cut the first cover of &quot;Maybellene&quot;), ancient country-folk accompanied solely by acoustic guitar (&quot;The Dream of the Miner's Chill&quot;), Hawaiiana (&quot;Aloha Oe&quot;), and a handful of his country-pop outings arranged by Ray Conniff. ~ Mark A.
