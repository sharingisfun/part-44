Not the clean cut guy - often big talking, slow acting, lacking in spirit and conviction!\nI needed something graphic to tie into the hero/villain idea.\nI personally have been collecting Owls for some time and the Owl in many different cultures is seen as both the hero and villain.\nIn Ireland an Owl that enters a house must be killed at once, for if it flies away it will takes the luck of the house with it.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, Aborigines believe bats represent the souls of men and Owls the souls of woman. Owls are therefore sacred in their culture because your sister is an Owl and the Owl is your sister.\nFor the Aztecs, one of their evil gods wore a screech Owl on his head and in the Celtic culture, the Owl is the sign of the Underworld.\nSo, the OWL was the obvious choice as I wanted to feel as connected to the artwork as I do to the music and also give DevilDriver another icon to work with and even further define us a band!\n\nSo we bring you\nPRAY FOR VILLAINS\n\n1.
