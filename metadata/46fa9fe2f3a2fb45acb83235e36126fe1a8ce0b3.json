It was the second single from that album, and it reached #22 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart that year. &quot;Dreams&quot; also appeared on the soundtrack to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie almost 10 years later, which introduced Van Halen to a new generation of potential fans. &quot;Dreams&quot; was written during the Hagar era of the band and has become a staple at concerts. It was performed during most tours featuring Sammy Hagar, including the most recent Hagar reunion tour.\n\nThere were technically three music videos made for the song. The most well known version was shot in 1986 and featured the Blue Angels performing a variety of aerial stunts. This video is that version.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46fa9fe2f3a2fb45acb83235e36126fe1a8ce0b3","amp;dn":"Van+Halen+-+Dreams+%28Blue+Angels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46fa9fe2f3a2fb45acb83235e36126fe1a8ce0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,250,159,226,243,162,251,69,172,184,50,53,227,97,38,254,26,140,224,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
