Powell too often mistakes frenzy for frisson, employing splatters of sound virtually bereft of cohesion -- it's pure sonic overkill, and it makes for awkward, grating listening.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Face On - John Powell  [4:58]\n02 - 80 Proof Rock - John Powell  [4:29]\n03 - Furniture - John Powell  [7:12]\n04 - The Golden Section Derma Lift - John Powell  [3:15]\n05 - This Ridiculous Chin - John Powell  [6:51]\n06 - No More Drugs for That Man - John Powell  [7:28]\n07 - Hans' Loft - John Powell  [3:37]\n08 - Ready for the Big Ride, Bubba - John Powell  [3:53]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed74de5f46801de231b32c85c6cdaabaa6551028","amp;dn":"Face%2FOff+-+Soundtrack+%282006%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed74de5f46801de231b32c85c6cdaabaa6551028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,116,222,95,70,128,29,226,49,179,44,133,198,205,170,186,166,85,16,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
