The camera angles and poses differ on the 7&quot; Vinyl, the 12&quot; Vinyl, the CD and Cassette. Usually each one has more than one. On the L12, there is a picture of a different woman.\n\nIt is the only Depeche Mode single to chart higher on the Billboard Hot 100 (#15) than on the UK Singles Chart (#16). It also became the band's second chart-topper on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe B-side is &quot;Kaleid&quot; (pronounced &quot;collide&quot;), which has an extended version called When Worlds Mix. Unlike many of the prior instrumentals which were piano compositions, this one is a rough techno instrumental. &quot;Kaleid&quot; is not produced by Depeche Mode and Flood, but just Depeche Mode.\n\nThe Trancentral Mix is by The KLF, a very popular techno band at that time and one of only 3 occasions that they did remix work for other artists, the other being So Hard and its B-side &quot;It must be obvious&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys and &quot;What Is Dub?&quot; by Moody Boys.\n\nCapitol Mix uses the sample &quot;I want to tell you my side of the case&quot; from the Checkers speech by Richard Nixon.\n\nA version of &quot;Kaleid&quot; was used as intro music for Depeche Mode's world tour in 1990.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; is directed by Anton Corbijn and appears on the VHS collection Strange Too.\n\nDespite its success as a single, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; was not included on the band's Best of... hits collection of 2006.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a49ef8cdb50ab100dc5e8fb9e5163f40d969093","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Policy+Of+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a49ef8cdb50ab100dc5e8fb9e5163f40d969093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,73,239,140,219,80,171,16,13,197,232,251,158,81,99,244,13,150,144,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
