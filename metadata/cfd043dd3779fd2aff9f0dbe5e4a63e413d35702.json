Your job is to help a small group of settlers survive and carve out a place for themselves in a hostile land. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, and find a way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. \n\nStarting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, Stonehearth combines city sim and good old combat with infinite building possibilities. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game, and share them with friends.\n\n\n== Features:\nBuild and Grow Your City\nThe heart of the game is city building and management. When you're just starting out, you'll need to juggle tasks like obtaining a sustainable food supply, building shelter, and defending your fledgling settlement from raiders and other threats. \nOnce you've achieved a foothold in the world, it's up to you to write the destiny for your people. \n\nLevel Up Your Settlers\nAll the settlers in your towns have jobs. A job is like a class in a role playing game. Each job has a specific role like hauling materials, building, crafting, and fighting. As your hearthlings work at a job they will gain experience and levels. Some jobs, when they meet certain prerequisites, can upgrade to entirely new jobs with new capabilities. \n\nEpic Boss Fights!\nAs your town becomes more wealthy and prosperous, you risk attracting the attention of one of the world's Titans, epic boss monsters looking to protect their turf, or just to plunder your riches. Each boss will have a unique lore and set of abilities used to lay waste to your city. (The Titans are hanging back during Early Access... but they're coming.)\n\nPlayer Driven Legacy Through Modding\nWe LOVE mods and want to make it as easy as possible to author and share mods. \nWant to see a new kind of sword in the game? You can model it, define its stats, and then craft it in game. You can also share the design with other players so they can enjoy it too, or bring their authored content into your game. \n\nAs a modder youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to do basically anything that we as developers can do: introduce new items and monsters, write new scripted adventures, influence the AI, you name it. It goes back to that original pen and paper RPG experience, where Ã¢â‚¬Å“the gameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a collaboration between the core ruleset and the stories crafted by the gamemaster.\n\n\n== Version:\nStonehearth Alpha 10.5, version 0.1.0 release 393 from June 9, 2015 \n\n\n== Version changes:\nBetter Error Window\nThe error window is much improved and can now be closed permanently via the Close Permanently button. Click the Close Permanently button if you never want to see any error messages in this play session again. If you DO still want to see error messages, so that you can take pictures and send them to us (much appreciated!), then just close the window the usual way, by hitting the Ã¢â‚¬Å“closeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ button in the upper right corner. Unfortunately, updating the window borked our file paths such that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“closeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ link is invisible, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re so used to hitting the button that muscle memory will help you get by. Please still go click there; your belief will make it work. (Fixing for next release.) \n\nStart Up Diagnostics\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added a lot more diagnostics to help determine the cause of crashes on start up. Although this build may still crash on start up, the data it provides will help us fix the issue. \n\nAlso, if you are having problems launching the game on Windows 7, make sure Service Pack 1 is installed. \n\nBug Fixes\nLua no longer consumes 100% CPU after multiple errors. \nRemoving a building after starting construction no longer generates a\nscaffolding error. \nDeleting a building after placing template no longer throws errors. \nWorkers will now restock items acquired from the trader. \nYou can now promote even when the talisman is located at high altitude. \nItems in stockpiles at high altitude are now included in inventory/score. \nHitting escape while planting banner no longer throws a UI error. \nFixed errors when shepherd is chasing down sheep. \nFixed waterfall error when water bodies are merging. \nErrors from aggro_observer are now fixed. \nRendering errors that resulted in light shafts / god rays emanating from light sources is fixed.\n\nOther Changes\nParty menu now has hotkey Ã¢â‚¬ËœgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Pargy? No! G for group! Clearly. \nVarious tooltips fixed.\n\n\n== Instructions:\n1. Extract anywhere (7zip - download link below)\n2.
