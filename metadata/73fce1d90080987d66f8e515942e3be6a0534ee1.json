I hadn't But i have always thought there should've been a remake to the original Zelda. and as it turns out there were several. but they were only released in japan by nintendo themselves and not on a cartridge but rather a sattelite based add on for super famicom called satellaview.\nHere ive added the ones i found relavent the wonderful people on their homepage have taken the time to work the bugs out of them, translate them to english and replace the little character in the game with an image of link as it should be.\nthere is much more content on the webpage and the content ive placed here has been renamed to my liking but all credit should go to their homepage. the game is called BS Legend of Zelda which there are several different versions of as it was released more than once and also a few rearranged versions of link to the Past.\n\n\nThe webpage i found this is Here     \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bszelda.zeldalegends.net/bszelda.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bszelda.zeldalegends.net/bszelda.shtml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73fce1d90080987d66f8e515942e3be6a0534ee1","amp;dn":"Original+Zelda+remakes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73fce1d90080987d66f8e515942e3be6a0534ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,252,225,217,0,128,152,125,102,248,229,21,148,46,59,230,160,83,78,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
