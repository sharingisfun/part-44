Salvo's massive, four-disc ANTHOLOGY collects all of these\nseminal early singles and contains generous samplings from the remainder of the\ngroup's career, including 30 previously unreleased tracks.\n\n2008 limited edition four CD box set from the '60s band led by the genius mind of Roy\nWood. The first pressing comes with five exclusive Move postcards and a doublesided\nposter! More than 40 years in the making. 62 career-spanning tracks and well\nover three hours of Move magnificence in one superbly remastered box set!
