There is also a noticeable African influence, with Mousstapha Cisse on percussion and Guy Nsangue Akwa on bass. &quot;Mouna Bowa&quot; is the first track that restricts itself to some straight forward swing by Ponty; he has a clear, precise tone and a sizzling technique, the whole band is articulate and inventive, this track is great fun. With tracks that carry words in the titles like &quot;Imaginary&quot;, &quot;Infinite&quot;, &quot;Mirage&quot; and &quot;Enigmatic&quot; it is no surprise that the music is often atmospheric, complex and electronic in form. This is world music and fusion that shimmers and spirals. This is music for the connoisseur.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
