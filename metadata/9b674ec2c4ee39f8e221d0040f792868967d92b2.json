The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ taking their cues from their parents ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶ inherited the same animosity towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b674ec2c4ee39f8e221d0040f792868967d92b2","amp;dn":"Naruto+%5BS04%5D+%5BE132-185%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b674ec2c4ee39f8e221d0040f792868967d92b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,103,78,194,196,238,57,248,226,33,208,4,15,121,40,104,150,125,146,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
