The result is twelve utterly charming pop tracks, which skip between boundaries with gleeful abandon and an acidic sense of humour.\n\nFrom the post-punk sturm and drang of Fonz to the skiffle-beat pop confections of Rings Around Rosa to the disarmingly beautiful 30ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s-style balladeering of Those Black And White Movies, the album veers from unabashed, starry-eyed romance to pre-coital forked-tongue come-ons via a sound thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simultaneously cinematic and yet endearingly ramshackle.\n\nEugene McGuinnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album contains knowing winks and phrases drawn from personal experience, but mostly made up scenarios full of joyous verve and unpredictability. It is a collection of songs gloriously out of time yet thoroughly modern, with one foot in reality and the other somewhere else entirely, where every silver lining has a cloud and one unexpected turn of phrase can lead you down a new musical rabbit hole.\n\n\n      01.
