Within that rich literature of suffering, Arthur RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Season in HellÃ¢â‚¬â€œwritten when the poet was nineteenÃ¢â‚¬â€œprovides an astonishing example of the grapple with self. \n\nAs a companion to RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey, readers could have no better guide than Wyatt Mason. One of our most talented young translators and critics, MasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new version of A Season in Hell renders the music and mystery of RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tale of Hell on Earth with exceptional finesse and power. \n\nThis bilingual edition includes maps, a helpful chronology of RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and the unfinished suite of prose poems, Illuminations. With A Season in Hell, they cement RimbaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation as one of the foremost, and most influential, writers in French literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:327d797cb197834c7f0828d7483b1ae9603f8f81","amp;dn":"A+Season+in+Hell+%26amp%3B+Illuminations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"327d797cb197834c7f0828d7483b1ae9603f8f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,125,121,124,177,151,131,76,127,8,40,215,72,59,26,233,96,63,143,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
