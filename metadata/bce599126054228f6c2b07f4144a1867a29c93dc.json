See the â€˜Contents.rtfâ€™ file for a full list.\r\n\r\n(*A big â€˜Thank You!â€™ to CatNibbles, for locating, and providing book 15Â½)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the â€œSource Filesâ€ folders, and do I need them?\r\n\r\n- Each Regenerated ebook folder contains a MOBI file (for Kindle eBook readers), a, EPUB file (for most other eBook readers), and a Source Files folder. The Source Files folder contains all the graphics files used in the regenerated eBook, as well as the RTF text file used to generate the eBook (and in many cases, the original PDF file, where I could find them). These files are only necessary if you wish to make modifications to the eBooks yourself. \r\nThese eBooks were created with Legend Maker for the Macintosh (available via the App Store, or the companyâ€™s own web site), and the RTF files are designed to be used with this utility. \r\nThe Source Files ARE NOT needed to use the resulting eBook files, and may be discarded at your discretion. HOWEVER, if you plan on re-distributing this collection, you should include these files.\r\n\r\nIâ€™ve found (and corrected) some errors. What do I do now?\r\n\r\n- At the time of this writing, this collection is wandering the internet, searching for a more permanent home. You may notice that each eBook has a version number placed in the upper right corner of the first page. My hope is that this collection will evolve, and further refined versions of eBooks will take the place of the eBooks Iâ€™ve regenerated for this collection.\r\nIf you find mistakes (and there are plenty, I have no doubt), please make whatever corrections you deem necessary in the RTF file, and check back periodically where you found this collection. If/when a permanent home is located, contact information on where to send your corrections will be included in this read me file at a future date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce599126054228f6c2b07f4144a1867a29c93dc","amp;dn":"Regenerated+e-Books+-+Encyclopedia+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce599126054228f6c2b07f4144a1867a29c93dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,229,153,18,96,84,34,143,108,43,7,244,20,74,24,103,162,156,147,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
