After giving a few more listens, though, it grew to be   |\n|   one of the more-liked discs in my collection. There was something about    |\n|   their fusion of electronic music and lyrics (albeit stream-of-conscious,   |\n|   surreal nonsensical ones) that I really found appealing. They were the     |\n|   only group to that point to pull it off with any success at all and it     |\n|   prompted me to search out all their subsequent releases and purchase       |\n|   them as well. The great thing about them, was that they hadn't             |\n|   dissapointed me yet with anything. After releasing the Pearls Girl EP in   |\n|   1997, though, they kind of dropped-off the face of the planet to take      |\n|   some time off and then record their new disc.                              |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Over the course of the last few months, the buzz for it has been           |\n|   building steadily and I read several different places proclaiming          |\n|   (probably before they had heard anything from the disc itself) that it     |\n|   just could be the album that breaks electronica truly into the             |\n|   mainstream and positions Underworld atop the heap. It was quite a bit to   |\n|   shoulder for one group, and now that I've heard the album, I know that     |\n|   nothing that I've been hearing will probably happen. It's not that the     |\n|   album is bad, it's just that it's not going to appeal to the masses.       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   I'll even admit that the first time I heard the disc, I was                |\n|   underwhelmed. I'm sure it was partially due to my own personal             |\n|   expectations, and partially due to all the things that had been swirling   |\n|   in my ears. Once again, though, after a couple listens, I've found it      |\n|   near the top of my rotation pile. The disc starts out with &quot;Cups,&quot; an      |\n|   almost 12-minute track that doesn't really get going until about 8         |\n|   minutes through. After that, though, the disc follows on cue as some       |\n|   excellent work (minus my like/hate relationship with track 7 entitled,     |\n|   &quot;Bruce Lee&quot;). &quot;Shudder/King Of Snake&quot; is a 10-minute track in the vein     |\n|   of some of their older, pounding work and mellow tracks like &quot;Winjer&quot;      |\n|   and &quot;Skym&quot; provide a bit of calm before the blistering of &quot;Kittens&quot; and    |\n|   the pounding &quot;Born Slippy&quot;-like album closer entitled, &quot;Moaner.&quot; If you    |\n|   like the groups other work, you'll definitely want to pick this up, even   |\n|   though it may take awhile to grow on you. Just don't expect a              |\n|   revolution.
