These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.\n\n\nEpisode Info: Meth and Ecstasy; two of the most popular and dangerous synthetic drugs on the planet. It's a deadly billion-dollar industry in Canada and it's linked to gangs and organized crime. These drugs devastate communities and destroy lives. Watch as the RCMP locates, targets and takes down the Clan Labs that are destroying our country's future\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bde66dd3ac193f24656d6929260436df986bb5b","amp;dn":"Courage.in.Red.S01E07.Clan.Labs.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bde66dd3ac193f24656d6929260436df986bb5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,222,102,221,58,193,147,242,70,86,214,146,146,96,67,109,249,134,187,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
