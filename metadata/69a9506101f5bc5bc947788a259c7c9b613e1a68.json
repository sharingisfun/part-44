My Life in Review \n\nI first heard of this band years ago from their appearance in the 1970 drug flick The People Next Door. I searched for years trying to find an album and failed miserably. When I finally ran across a vinyl copy, it was way out of my price range, so I simply gave up and forgot about it.\n\nHere it is years later, and I again watch The People Next Door. I begin the quest anew to find this intriguing, obscure musical group. Fortunately by this time Fallout Records has released this long lost gem of an album (along with the music I first heard in the movie as bonus cuts). The band didn't write the movie cuts, and their actual material sounds a bit different, but it is quite good, actually really good. Very enjoyable jazzy rock with a lot of fuzz, and some country and classical flavor thrown in. Well played and well sung. Lead vocalist and drummer Jim Hodder would go on to fame with Steely Dan. While sounding similar to other bands of the era on the surface, the music really opens up with repeated listens. The song writing and arrangements are mature and appealing.\n\nThis CD sounds like it came from vinyl, though it still sounds good. While a bit sparse, the liner notes are quite informative. Not much to complain about really. Another fine Boston band(along with Ultimate Spinach). Worth your time and money.
