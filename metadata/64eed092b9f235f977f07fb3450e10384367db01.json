One of the reasons I love EPs is because, with their short length, they tend to be much more consistent than full albums, and Okkervil River certainly doesn't disappoint there. This isn't B-side material, it could easily contend with some of the tracks on their full releases, it's just a short collection of thematically-related, well-written songs.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/15/okkervil-river/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/15/okkervil-river/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64eed092b9f235f977f07fb3450e10384367db01","amp;dn":"Okkervil+River...Sleep+and+Wake-Up+Songs%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64eed092b9f235f977f07fb3450e10384367db01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,238,208,146,185,242,53,249,119,240,127,179,69,14,16,56,67,103,219,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
