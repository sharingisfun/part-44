But I realized there are couple of really cool songs among them and deserve posting. Some of the ultra obscure bands that are featured here are Natural Scientist, Shadows As Tall As Trees, Standing Waves, Allez Allez, Whizz For Atoms and Richard Strange. Hope you enjoy it. \n\n\nRare Hits of The 80s Vol. 37\n\n01 Natural Scientist - See Through You\n02 Bolland &amp; Bolland - Images\n03 Fiction Factory - Everyone But You\n04 Breakfast Club - Right On Track\n05 Vision - Tears Idle Tears\n06 Silent Running - Heartland\n07 Geisha - Part Time Love Affair\n08 One to One - Hold Me Now\n09 Cutting Crew - (Another one of my) Big Ideas\n10 Paradox - One Look\n11 Shadows As Tall As Trees - Now Don't Cry\n12 Standing Waves - Vertigo\n13 Academy - Stranded\n14 Music For Pleasure - Fuel To The Fire\n15 Thomas Lang - The Happy Man\n16 Bone Symphony - Everything I Say is a Lie\n17 Zerra One - Ten Thousand Voices\n18 Hollywood Beyond - Save Me\n19 Strange Advance - Love Becomes Electric\n20 Paparazzi - Tell Me\n21 Allez Allez - Valley Of The Kings\n22 Dugites - Cut the Talking\n23 Whizz For Atoms - That Sinking Feeling\n24 Animotion - Let Him Go\n25 Bolland &amp; Bolland - Night of The Shooting Stars\n26 Mood Six - Hanging Around\n27 Richard Strange - International Language\n28 Vision - Breakdown\n29 Box of Toys - Time Takes Me Back\n30 Red Box - Heart Of The Sun\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e62840665cc2a55b6d5d0566061315392c866236","amp;dn":"Rare+Hits+of+The+80s+Vol.+37","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e62840665cc2a55b6d5d0566061315392c866236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,40,64,102,92,194,165,91,109,93,5,102,6,19,21,57,44,134,98,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
