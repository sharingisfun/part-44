As he developed from shock politician to supreme leader of Nazi Germany, he collected a long list of enemies along the way.\n\nProtecting Hitler was one of the world's toughest jobs. During his time in power he survived over 40 attempts on his life thanks to his fearless bodyguards.\n\nThe series, narrated by Robert Powell, looks in greater detail at these plots, from Hitler's early political career where he knew he was a marked man to the infamous Stauffenberg plot. Hitler's Bodyguard also reveals why Churchill and Roosevelt did nothing to directly harm him or try to assassinate him.\n\n\nBroadcast\n17th November - 3rd December 2008\n5:00pm - 6:00pm\nUKTV History\n\nTorrent includes all 13 episodes\n\nTypical File Info\nFile Name ..........: Hitler's Bodyguard - proper.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 375.01 MB\n\nVideo Length .......: 00:46:18\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1004 KB/s\nResolution .........: 624 x 464\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.34:1\nframerate ..........: 25 FPS\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n\n\nThanks to the original capper and uploader","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4754848a1e93444dc013c26c5c3cc02e5fd6df9","amp;dn":"Hitler%5C%27s+Bodyguard-+complete+1-13+%5BXviD%5D+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4754848a1e93444dc013c26c5c3cc02e5fd6df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,117,72,72,161,233,52,68,220,1,60,38,197,195,204,2,229,253,109,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
