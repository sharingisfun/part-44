The song entered the Canadian Hot 100 at #34 on the 36th week of 2009 and is currently in the top ten at #8. It is about reality television shows being fabricated, and references several TV shows and stars.\n\nCha-Ching was filmed on August 24th 2009 in Liberty Village, Toronto. The video was released September 17, 2009, premiering on MuchMusic. In the video, the band is shown performing, as well as mocking the TV shows and celebrities referenced in the song. This is ironic, as the Hedley's lead singer placed third on reality TV series Canadian Idol.\n\nReferences in the song\n\n    * The Real World\n    * American Idol/Canadian Idol\n    * The Biggest Loser\n    * Survivor\n    * Kim Kardashian\n    * Tila Tequila\n    * Flavor Flav\n    * Verne Troyer\n    * The Hills\n    * MTV\n    * TMZ\n    * Playboy\n\nThe Show Must Go is Hedley's third full length album and was released on November 17, 2009 in Canada. \n\nHedley is a Canadian pop rock band comprising lead singer Jacob Hoggard, who was placed 3rd during the second season of the reality TV series Canadian Idol in 2004, Tommy Mac on bass, Dave Rosin on the guitar and Chris Crippin on drums. The current band retains the original name of Hoggard's pre-Canadian Idol group, although the membership has changed. The band originated in Abbotsford, British Columbia and was named after the town of Hedley, British Columbia, a name chosen after members heard that it was for sale for $346,000. While the idea of buying the town ran its course, the name remained.\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7dc958426290fcffecc59ea7553aeedf0a27e9","amp;dn":"Hedley+-+Cha-Ching+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7dc958426290fcffecc59ea7553aeedf0a27e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,125,201,88,66,98,144,252,255,236,197,158,167,85,58,238,223,10,39,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
