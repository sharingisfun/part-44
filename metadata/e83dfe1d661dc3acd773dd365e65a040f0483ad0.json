It also covers the movie Star Trek: Insurrection. The supplement is as meticulously detailed as the rest of the volume, listing such fascinating trivia as chadre kab (Seven of Nine's first meal), 'Kahless and Lukara' (a Klingon opera), and voraxna (a Cardassian poison), as well as all the new characters and species. Appendices include illustrations of starships, cast and crew listings, a historical timeline, and a bibliography. All photographs and illustrations (except for a few historical shots) are in color. The encyclopedia was devised in part to help production staff on the various Star Trek TV series to keep up with the ever-increasing level of detail generated by over 30 years of creative effort. It is an excellent reference volume and, whether you want to settle an argument or write a novel, this book will answer your questions. But beware: the extensive cross-referencing leads to curious time-distortion effects, in which the unwary reader, dipping in to settle a single query, encounters an irresistible urge to browse further, during which hours of normal time can pass in the wink of an eye. --Elizabeth Sourbut --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n\nLots of color photos, and half of the 5000-plus entries are new.\nCopyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\n\nFROM THE UPLOADER:  I'm the same guy that scanned the complete star wars encyclopedia.  In doing so it didn't feel right to not put the star trek encyclopedia up as well.  I didn't scan as aggressively so it took about 17 days of occasional scanning to get the whole book done this time.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83dfe1d661dc3acd773dd365e65a040f0483ad0","amp;dn":"The+Star+Trek+Encyclopedia+3rd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83dfe1d661dc3acd773dd365e65a040f0483ad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,61,254,29,102,29,195,172,215,115,221,54,94,101,160,64,240,72,58,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
