The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Theodore Roosevelt\n\nEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.\n\nIn Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truthÃ¢â‚¬â€and trustÃ¢â‚¬â€in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.
