Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar), Tom Diello (drums), and Tim Cronin (vocals and bass). The band first went under the name &quot;Dog of Mystery&quot; and later &quot;Airport 75&quot; before finally settling on &quot;Monster Magnet,&quot; taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child.\n\n\n\n\nBest Of (20th Century Masters) 2007\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nHeads Explode\nDopes to Infinity\nSpace Lord\nBlack Balloon\nTemple of Your Dreams\nTwin Earth\nTractor\nCrop Circle\nPowertrip\nSilver Future\nNegasonic Teenage Warhead\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7eb1cce58e53d84207eda7d882f443394f702d5","amp;dn":"Monster+Magnet+-+Best+of+2007+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7eb1cce58e53d84207eda7d882f443394f702d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,235,28,206,88,229,61,132,32,126,218,125,136,47,68,51,148,247,2,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
