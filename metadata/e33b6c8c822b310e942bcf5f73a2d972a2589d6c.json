It was the first book based on computer-generated position databases that are guaranteed to provide the actual result of a position.\nHowever, this book is no computer print-out. It takes a human 'oracle' to extract the useful information from this mass of data and to identify new principles to help the rest of us appreciate the key practical points. Dr John Nunn, top-class grandmaster and renowned theoretician, performs this role admirably. He has identified where previous theory has been overturned, and where there are important new results. Dr Nunn was also the first to reveal the general importance of the many 'reciprocal zugzwang' positions.\n* The complete truth about the ending Rook and Pawn vs Rook\n* One of the most important and controversial chess books of the twentieth century\n* An essential addition to every serious chess-player's library\n* A new expanded editi! on\nAbout the Author\nJohn Nunn is a grandmaster from England.
