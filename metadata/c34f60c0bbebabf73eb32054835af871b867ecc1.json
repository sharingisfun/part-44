Enough, no more,\nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\n[Music ceases]\nO spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou\nThat, notwithstanding thy capacity\nReceiveth as the sea, naught enters there,\nOf what validity and pitch so eÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er,\nBut falls into abatement and low price\nEven in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy\nThat it alone is high fantastical. \n\nPuritan Virtue, sick on account of self-love, is overthrown by aristocratic Idleness and Folly. An excellent production from the BBC Radio Collection directed by Richard Eyre (c.2001)\n\n(Kindly seed, and if you can't find a seed for any previous poetry torrent go to the folder 'Current Poetry Torrents' and follow the instructions on the pdf.)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34f60c0bbebabf73eb32054835af871b867ecc1","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+8+-+Twelfth+Night+bbc+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c34f60c0bbebabf73eb32054835af871b867ecc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,79,96,192,187,235,171,247,62,179,32,84,131,90,248,113,184,103,236,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
