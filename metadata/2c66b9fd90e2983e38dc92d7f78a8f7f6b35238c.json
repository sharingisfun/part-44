American Comics Group, 1946.\n\nMilt Gross (March 4, 1895 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 29, 1953), was an American cartoonist and animator. His work is noted for its exaggerated cartoon style and Yiddish-inflected English dialogue. He originated the non-sequitur &quot;Banana Oil!&quot; as a phrase deflating pomposity and posing. His character Count Screwloose's admonition, &quot;Iggy, keep an eye on me!&quot;, became a national catch phrase. The National Cartoonists Society fund to aid indigent cartoonists and their families for many years was known as the Milt Gross Fund. In 2005, it was absorbed by the Society's Foundation, which continues the charitable work of the Fund.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c66b9fd90e2983e38dc92d7f78a8f7f6b35238c","amp;dn":"Milt+Gross%3A+Milt+Gross+Funnies+%23+1-2+%28American+Comics+Group%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c66b9fd90e2983e38dc92d7f78a8f7f6b35238c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,102,185,253,144,226,152,62,56,220,146,215,247,138,143,127,107,53,35,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
