But since there seems to be a lot &quot;similarly&quot;\n &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the source material, it\n has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to change as I experience more variations.\n Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra\n clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe\n to the notion that they represent the best source 95% of the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae816b640a336a1887dfbd085eb29307badc0d88","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Ambrosia+-+Ambrosia+-+1975%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae816b640a336a1887dfbd085eb29307badc0d88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,129,107,100,10,51,106,24,135,223,189,8,94,178,147,7,186,220,13,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
