Interlaced with current event jokes, Zach played a piano and included the non-sequiturs he usually uses in his act. After this, one or two skits starring Zach followed. One of the running skits was footage of red carpet interviews edited with Zach's obviously different questions. Last, Zach met with a guest (like Mathew St. Patrick) or had a musical guest play (like Rhett Miller).\n\nArguably, Late World was most famous for its live suicides concluding every show. The identities of the victims were never revealed but most had signed waivers freeing the staff of Late World of any responsibility.\n\nThe series was cancelled after nine weeks of production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:758eb0e6d5c4d2d085f5e2dcd84ba6ded6356718","amp;dn":"Late+World+with+Zach+Galifianakis+comedy+29+episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"758eb0e6d5c4d2d085f5e2dcd84ba6ded6356718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,142,176,230,213,196,210,208,133,245,226,220,216,75,166,222,214,53,103,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
