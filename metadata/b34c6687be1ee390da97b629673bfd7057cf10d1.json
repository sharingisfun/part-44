The group consisted of psychedelic rock musicians, and they incorporated sunshine pop harmonies. The roots of the band lie in several groups. Boettcher had originally worked with drummer Ron Edgar for a brief time in the folk group The GoldeBriars. Following the dissolution of The GoldeBriars, Edgar joined the group The Music Machine, which also featured Doug Rhodes on bass. The Music Machine scored a Top 20 hit with the song &quot;Talk Talk&quot; before disbanding. Boettcher had also formed a group called The Ballroom, which featured Sandy Salisbury as a vocalist. Lee Mallory had worked as a songwriter and solo performer, and Boettcher had produced some of his recordings, including a cover of Phil Ochs' &quot;That's The Way It's Gonna Be.&quot; The group also featured support from session musicians such as Jerry Scheff.\nThe Millennium recorded one album, Begin in 1968. Before disbanding, the group recorded one follow-up single: &quot;Just About The Same&quot; b/w &quot;Blight,&quot; as well as several tracks that were later released on compilation albums. Boettcher went on to make several attempts at recording solo albums (only one was released during his lifetime, There's An Innocent Face), as did Salisbury and Joey Stec. Michael Fennelly would end up in the early 1970s group Crabby Appleton, who signed with Elektra Records and released two albums, scoring a Top 40 hit with the single &quot;Go Back.&quot; Stec founded the record label Sonic Past Music in the late 1990s, and this label has subsequently released previously unavailable albums from The Millennium, Boettcher, Salisbury, Mallory, and Stec.\nallmuic.com / biography by Richie Unterberger\nInfluenced by psychedelia and California rock, pop/rock producer Curt Boettcher (the Association) decided to assemble a studio supergroup who would explore progressive sounds in 1968. Millennium's resultant album would find no commercial success and only half-baked artistic success, but nonetheless retains some period charm. Influenced in roughly equal measures by the Association, the Mamas and the Papas, the Smile-era Beach Boys, Nilsson, the Left Banke, and the Fifth Dimension, Boettcher and his friends came up with a hybrid that was at once too unabashedly commercial for underground FM radio and too weird for the AM dial. It would have fit in better on the AM airwaves, though; the almost too-cheerful sunshine harmonies and catchy melodies dominate the suite-like, diverse set of elaborately produced '60s pop/rock tunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34c6687be1ee390da97b629673bfd7057cf10d1","amp;dn":"The+Millennium+At+Last+-+2012+-+8+Blu-spec+CD+Box+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34c6687be1ee390da97b629673bfd7057cf10d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,76,102,135,190,30,227,144,218,151,182,41,103,59,253,112,87,207,16,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
