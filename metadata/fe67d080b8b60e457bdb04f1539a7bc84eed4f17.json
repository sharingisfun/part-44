His eponymous solo debut, a bare-bones collection of acoustic dirges and poignant country-tinged folk tunes, seems cut from the same era, but with a far gentler hand. The appropriately titled opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Begin,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be the litmus test for most listeners, as its languid, dreamlike cadence provides the foundation for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come. SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skillful blend of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's balladry, 16 Horsepower's torrential brimstone, Bert Jansch's intricate guitar work, and Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billy's loose delivery works best on apocalyptic tumbleweed epics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Dust Does BlowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“A House Up on the Hill,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both of which manage to sound visceral and urgent despite their molasses-fueled trajectory. Armed with nothing but his reedy voice, guitar, and the occasional harmonium, bulbul tarang (Indian banjo), and backing vocal, Simon makes a big sound out of very little, and much like contemporaries Faun Fables, Espers, and Woven Hand, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both achingly familiar and alarmingly wild.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe67d080b8b60e457bdb04f1539a7bc84eed4f17","amp;dn":"Jason+Simon+-+Jason+Simon+%5B2010%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe67d080b8b60e457bdb04f1539a7bc84eed4f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,103,208,128,184,182,14,69,123,219,4,241,83,154,123,200,78,237,79,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
