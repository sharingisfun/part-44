By the mid-1980s Lovett had already distinguished himself in the burgeoning Texas singer-songwriter scene. He had performed in the New Folk competition at the Kerrville Folk Festival in 1980 and returned to win in 1982.  In 1984 Lovett recorded a four song demo with the help of the Phoenix band, J. David Sloan and the Rogues. His music had begun to be distributed by the Fast Folk Musical Magazine.\n\nLyle Lovett has been cited as one of the top 100 albums of the 1980s by the Italian magazines Il Mucchio Selvaggio and Velvet Allmusic compares the album to Steve Earle's Guitar Town, calling it, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœone of the most promising and exciting debut albums to come out of Nashville in the 1980s.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ (wikipedia)\n\n- - -\n\nLyle Lovett - Lyle Lovett 1986\n(MCA, Curb)\n\n 1.
