The Chengdu Research Base in central China is at the heart of a project to breed 300 pandas, and then start introducing them back into the wild. It is the most ambitious and controversial conservation effort ever mounted. Shot over two years, this film follows the pandas and keepers as, through visionary science and round-the-clock care, they edge closer to the magic number of 300.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wmvl6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wmvl6&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs for HD\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.79 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S (BBC HD)\n\nXvid also available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b439ba8a818933657b00ceae391280a12b505fb","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+2010+Panda+Makers+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b439ba8a818933657b00ceae391280a12b505fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,67,155,168,168,24,147,54,87,176,12,234,227,145,40,10,18,181,5,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
