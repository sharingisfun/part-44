Its scenario offers you a riddle: to find the old organ master who has vanished. Solving various quests and gathering the clues just like in other classic hidden object games you'll find outlines of musical scores for your music box and reveal exclusive puzzles where you have to recreate masterpieces of classical and modern music out of smaller pieces. Unlike other puzzles, Musaic requires not just logic but a sense of musicality. Correctly composed melodies will lead you to the mystery's revelation and unlock new game mode. \nMusaic box Ã¢â‚¬â€œ now anyone can be a composer!\n\nGame features:\n- Unusual gameplay rewarded for excellence\n- Exciting music-based gameplay\n- Multiple masterpieces of classical and modern music \n- Stylish graphics\n\nGoogle play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.game.musaicbox","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de952c791fad69cb19d490886a1796a646677759","amp;dn":"Musaic+box","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de952c791fad69cb19d490886a1796a646677759","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,149,44,121,31,173,105,203,25,212,144,136,106,23,150,166,70,103,119,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
