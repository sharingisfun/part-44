This practical guide shows you how HTML5's JavaScript APIs give you the power to take web development into many fields that used to require platform-specific developmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½particularly mobile deployment.\n\nYou'll not only discover how to take advantage of local storage, geolocation, multithreaded processing, and flexible network connectivity with HTML5, you'll also learn many ways to make application development with JavaScript more powerful.\n\nLearn how HTML5 will bring about a radical change in web browser applications \nGet details about powerful toolkits that will help you program in JavaScript more efficiently \nDiscover powerful aspects of JavaScript that you may not be aware of, such as closures, lambda, and functional programming \nLearn how HTML5 lets your applications store data in the browser so that you're not bound to the server \nTake your app offline, and explore how an offline application cache can speed up page loading when the app is online \nUse HTML5 Web Workers to create multithreaded applications with JavaScript \nMake your application mobile through geolocation and other HTML5 elements \nLearn a new way to communicate between the browser and a server with web sockets \n\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X8scMJCaL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_AA278_PIkin4,BottomRight,-32,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg[/img]\n\nWhat Is HTML5?\n\nHTML5: EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s using it, nobody knows what it is. I realize that sounds more like a line out of an existential movie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ maybe Waiting for Godot or a screenplay by Sartre ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ than a statement about HTML5. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really the truth: most of the people using HTML5 are treating it as HTML4+, or even worse, HTML4 (and some stuff they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use). The result? A real delay in the paradigm shift that HTML5 is almost certain to bring. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly not time to look away, because by the time you look back, you may have missed something really important: a subtle but important transition centered around HTML5.\n\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pD3KTDZ2L._SL500_AA300_.jpg[/img]\n\nPaperback: 400 pages \nPublisher: O'Reilly Media (November 30, 2011) \nLanguage: English \nISBN-10: 1449396798 \nISBN-13: 978-1449396794 \nProduct Dimensions: 9.8 x 5.9 x 0.6 inches \n\nDive deep into the latest HTML5 features that really make the language shineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½everything from markup semantics to Canvas, web forms, application protocols, and the latest JavaScript APIs.\n\nWith more than 100 practical tips and techniques that you can use in your projects right away, the HTML Cookbook helps you experience HTML5's versatility firsthand.\n\nEach informative recipe includes a code solution, along with a detailed discussion into why and how it works. And each chapter has an example design to showcase the topics presented. This handy book is perfect for intermediate to advanced web and mobile web developers ready to take advantage of HTML5 immediately, with recipes on the following topics:\n\nBasic web syntax \nProgressive HTML5 markup techniques \nGeolocation \nWeb forms \nCanvas \nAudio and video \nMicrodata \nAdvanced JavaScript APIs \n\n\n[img]http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gELfuwv3L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg[/img]\n\nPaperback: 62 pages \nPublisher: O'Reilly Media (September 14, 2011) \nLanguage: English \nISBN-10: 1449307132 \nISBN-13: 978-1449307134 \n\nCreating standards-compliant animations for the Web just got a lot easier. With this concise guide, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to convert Flash animations into HTML5, using WallabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the experimental tool from Adobe. Wallaby makes Flash content available for devices that don't support Flash runtimes, including the iPhone and iPad.\n\nDeveloping HTML5 animations is time-consuming with all the coding required. This book shows you how to create compelling content for HTML5 environments with relative ease, whether you know Flash or not. After a quick introduction to simple animation building with Flash, you'll learn how Wallaby helps you convert those animations into HTML5 code.\n\nLearn how to create a simple Flash animation, using Flash Professional CS5 \nBecome familiar with the Flash Library, Stage drawing canvas, and animation Timeline \nTake the right approach to building a complex Flash animation for HTML5 \nGet performance tips to optimize animations for desktops and mobile devices \nUse simple JavaScript and CSS code to place the Wallaby animation in a web page \nAdd interactivity to your HTML5 animation with jQuery \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ecfa964a9100a422333a29041fa2e9882eeeb2","amp;dn":"4+Oreilly+HTML5+PDF+eBooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ecfa964a9100a422333a29041fa2e9882eeeb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,236,250,150,74,145,0,164,34,51,58,41,4,31,162,233,136,46,238,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
