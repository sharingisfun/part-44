Their explanation for a ridiculous amount of glitches in their release is that &quot;it is enbeaded into the \n                   stream and could not be avoided&quot; (it's spelled &quot;embedded&quot;, FYI). Yeah, that's a load of bullshit. This is \n                   when you would record the reair. If they had capped this from a digital source (which is required) it would \n                   have been nearly impossible to maintain sync. Not only was the release riddled with errors, the standard \n                   crappy CRiMSON deinterlacing was noticeable throughout. Here are a couple examples\n                   They are lucky that Lifetime does not reair full-length episodes or they would be propered in a heartbeat. If \n                   that's not enough, if you look at the waveform of their mp3 you'll notice that during the drops in audio \n                   there is still a waveform present. The waveform of a drop from a digital source is a straight line - no audio, \n                   hence the word &quot;drop&quot;. I'm no expert on the matter and I could be wrong, but this would lead me to believe \n                   that not only is their video from an analog source, their audio is also. Maybe this is why they don't pre any \n                   720ps. CRiMSON, you should pre some source proof just for the hell of it and show everyone that you're legit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:577261d776a89fab91eaf32475641e3ab5d74904","amp;dn":"Project.Runway.S09E06.The.Art.of.the.Matter.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"577261d776a89fab91eaf32475641e3ab5d74904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,114,97,215,118,168,159,171,145,234,243,36,117,100,30,58,181,215,73,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
