The objective in each stage is to clear all of the orange pegs by hitting them with a ball shot from the top of the screen. The game requires strategy to bounce the ball off pegs and other obstacles to clear as much of the level as possible with the given number of balls. There are also blue pegs (which have no effect other than increasing your score), purple pegs (which are worth 50 times the amount of the blue pegs), and green pegs (which activate your power-up based on the character you have selected). There is an option for those who are color blind which adds a triangle to the green pegs and a plus to the purple pegs to make them easier to distinguish. Scrolling across the bottom of the screen is the &quot;free ball bucket&quot; which awards the player an extra ball should the previous shot go in. wikipedia\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149d7390742ba0e6d8a6e1b7ec29055997ec41b8","amp;dn":"Peggle+for+mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149d7390742ba0e6d8a6e1b7ec29055997ec41b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,157,115,144,116,43,160,230,216,166,225,183,236,41,5,89,151,236,65,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
