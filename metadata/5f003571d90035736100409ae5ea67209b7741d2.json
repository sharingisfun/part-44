Whilst dated, this tome is still of use in evaluating devices that crop up on the second-hand market. Friedman also set up the &quot;New York School of Synthesis&quot; and provided a series of videos entitled &quot;Intro to Synthesis&quot;. Friedman presents the rudiments of this topic in an audio-visual format, whilst incorporating a unique sense of humor.&quot; Note the videos must be from 1988 or later as they reference the Korg M1. Thanks goes to Caixa in the comments for catching this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f003571d90035736100409ae5ea67209b7741d2","amp;dn":"Dean+Friedman+-+Intro+to+Synthesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f003571d90035736100409ae5ea67209b7741d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,0,53,113,217,0,53,115,97,0,64,154,229,234,103,32,155,119,65,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
