To find God is to find oneself; in finding oneself, one loses oneself in Him, in the Breath of God, and comes at last upon the ultimate truth.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This text, which can be found on the back of Hassan HaffarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CD cover, expresses exactly what the muezzin of the great mosque in Aleppo , Syria means: to find truth through song.\n\nThe muezzin Hassan Haffar is an expert in his field, but also a storyteller and poet. His exceptional voice has brought him fame, not only in his native Aleppo , but also internationally, as can be seen by the success of his CD Chants dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢extase en Islam. Although he is regularly invited abroad with the Munshed Ensemble of Aleppo (the term munshed meaning specialists in songs of praise, particularly religious ones), he prefers not to travel a great deal and his performances are infrequent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ce8a9be1e55aca89dd43e5328521d68cdea6d3","amp;dn":"Hassan+Haffar+-+1995+-+Songs+of+Ecstasy+In+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ce8a9be1e55aca89dd43e5328521d68cdea6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,206,138,155,225,229,90,202,137,221,67,229,50,133,33,214,140,222,166,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
