The Last Jubilee 2:01 \n\n\nRachel HarringtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique talent has deep roots. Being a single parent, having a strong Pentecostal upbringing and thriving in rural Oregon where she fondly recalls her ancestors, this singer-songwriter, who beats to a unique drum, finds ideas everywhere. \n\nGospel and Motown and standards by greats like George Jones and Loretta Lynn flooded her subconscious when she started learning guitar at the age of twelve.\n\nIn 2007, she produced her own record, 'The BootleggerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DaughterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which shot up to number one on the Euro-Americana Chart and landed on the number 36 spot on the Americana Music Association Chart. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“City of RefugeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ followed, as did a three month European tour. \n\nThe last several years have included multiple touring and opportunities to teach songwriting. These are skills which Harrington appears to have available in her back pocket. \n\nHer recent recording, 'Celilo Falls', contains 13 tracks; all written by Harrington except ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“House of CardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which she co- wrote with the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s producer Evan Brubaker and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SpokaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which was written by Art Hanlon. \n\nThe album is filled with HarringtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tear-soaked voice; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a voice thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from another generation, never slick or polished, or sonically airbrushed, it is genuine and undiluted. The themes are mostly wistful and occasionally humorous, but always subtle. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Goodbye AmsterdamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ends with this lovely stanza: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTime I get to Glasgow/ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll feel right at home/The rolling of the road settling inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“He Started Building My Mansion TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is based upon her grandfatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thoughts. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI feel it in my bones, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll soon be on my wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is how the conversation resulted in song. \n\nHarrington goes on to discover the beauty of place with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SpokaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStanding at the riverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlooking out on an empty groundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Harrington examines the details which colour our everyday locales.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pretty SaroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a tribute to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmerican musical lineageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which stems from the Scottish, English and Irish traditions. A plaintive ache appears as she sings, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen I think of Saro in dawnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early light/SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll always be crying as she was that poor night.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe levity comes through in a song about settling for someone who isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr. Right.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll DoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is brilliant in its work-a-day, natural discourse. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Blowing in the WindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of this generation. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho makes the moon do pirouettes? Who forgives, or just forgets, You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nThis is a simply structured series of verses which gradually build in meaning. \n\nThe romantic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Let Me Sleep in Your Arms TonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is pristine and poetic:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere the wildflowers bloom and the mustangs roam, the prairies ocean wideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThe final song is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Last JubileeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which is HarringtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œversion of heaven.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe songs are made more powerful with the addition of the following excellent musicians: Fiddle and pedal steel (Dan Salini), mandolin (Ronnie McCoury), slide guitar (Rod Clements) and bass (Jon Hamer).\n\nOn 'Celilo Falls', Rachel Harrington does a remarkable job of merging angelic vocals with twangy instrumentals, and infusing intimate family histories with just the right amount of seasoning.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/21/rachel-harrington/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/21/rachel-harrington/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de0ce5fb38e4780ac0277ce350f15f47b37ccbd4","amp;dn":"Rachel+Harrington...Celilo+Falls%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de0ce5fb38e4780ac0277ce350f15f47b37ccbd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,12,229,251,56,228,120,10,192,39,124,227,80,241,95,71,179,124,203,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
