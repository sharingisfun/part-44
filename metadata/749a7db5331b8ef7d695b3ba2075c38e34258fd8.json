It had something to do with brokerage firms, banks, lending companies.\n\nThat\\'s about all most of us know and comprehends, but this Sony Pictures Classics release documents the criminal fraud and greed of the financial services industry. Most impressively, it makes it understandable to those of us who don\\'t know much at all about economics.\n\n\\&quot;Inside Job\\&quot; presents a stunning array of interviews with a broad range of participants and commentators: hedge fund managers, business-school faculty, Justice Department officials, Federal Reserve chairmen, Congressmen and even a Wall Street \\&quot;Madam.\\&quot; However, \\&quot;Inside Job\\&quot; is no talking-heads drone. It\\'s a lively, droll and acidic shakedown of the insiders who perpetrated this crisis.\n\nFilmmaker Charles Ferguson exposes a level of greed that would make even Gordon Gekko cringe as such entities as Goldman Sachs actually made money by selling their clients worthless financial products and then betting against them.\n\nMost pointedly, Inside Job clearly illuminates the collusion between governmental agencies, the giant financial service companies and the hordes of insiders who slopped at both sides of the trough. In short, \\&quot;Inside Job\\&quot; exposes the conflicts of interest between brokerage, regulation and government.\n\nFurther, Inside Job also maps the conflict-of-interest rampant throughout top business schools, such as Harvard and Columbia, whose professors garner huge consulting fees by the very firms perpetrating the de-regulation mantra.\n\nRooting the crisis in the move toward de-regulation begun during the Reagan administration and now continuing under Obama, Inside Job illuminates how the Wall Street culprits who caused this crisis have moved through to the other side of the fence. Such financial services honchos/culprits as Bush appointee Hank Paulson and Obama-men Timothy Geithner and Larry Summers have held or now hold high presidential advisory posts.\n\nAs a farmer might say, \\&quot;It was the foxes getting in the hen house,\\&quot; referring to the financial services execs/crooks who have crossed over into high regulatory capacities.\n\nNarrated by Matt Damon and illuminated by the film\\'s revealing interview questions, Inside Job deserves, in stock terms, a triple-A rating.\n\nVenue: Festival de Cannes -- Special Screenings\nSales: Sony Pictures Classics\nProduction companies: Representational Pictures in association with Screen Pass Pictures\nCast: Matt Damon (narrator)\nDirector: Charles Ferguson\nProducer: Audrey Marrs\nDirectors of photography: Kalyanee Mam, Svetlana Cvetko\nEditors: Chad Beck, Adam Bolt. Music: Alex Heffes\nNo rating, 110 minutes\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nThis is what is coming and more.\nIf you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nMore Torrents in this series at          ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
