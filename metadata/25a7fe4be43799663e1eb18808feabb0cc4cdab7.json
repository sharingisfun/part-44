Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers). \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tBMG Ariola\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Alabama Song\n02.Want To Buy Some Illusions\n03.Pirate Jenny\n04.Salomon Song\n05.Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\n06.Complainte De La Seine\n07.The Ballad Of The Soldier\\'s Wife\n08.Intro\n09.Mon Ami (My Friend)\n10.Falling In Love Again\n11.Mack The Knife\n12.20th Century Blues\n13.Don\\'t Forget Me\n14.Surabaya Johnny\n15.Outro Street Singer\\'s Farewell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don\\'t forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a7fe4be43799663e1eb18808feabb0cc4cdab7","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+20th+Century+Blues+%281997%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a7fe4be43799663e1eb18808feabb0cc4cdab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,167,254,75,228,55,153,102,62,30,177,136,8,254,171,176,204,76,218,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
