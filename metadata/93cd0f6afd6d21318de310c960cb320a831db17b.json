It features members of the Santana band as backup, however, so the difference between a group effort and a solo work seems to be primarily in the musical approach, which is more esoteric, and more varied than on a regular band album. The record is mostly instrumental and given over largely to contemplative ballads, although there is also, for example, in the song &quot;Silver Dreams Golden Smiles,&quot; a traditional pop ballad sung by Saunders King. ~ William Ruhlmann, AMG\n\nFreeDB notes: This is a fairly obscure Santana album but it is one of his best in many ways. It has great melodies and outstanding lead guitar. Just listen to &quot;Cry of the Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Song for Devadip&quot; and you'll agree that his lead guitar work is as good or better than &quot;Europa&quot; or &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot;. Plus both songs really rock. Other songs have a great mix of strong lead singing filled in with more great guitar. I loved listening to this album for 10+ years. ~ BH, Amazon.com\n\nPersonnel:\nCarlos Santana (Guitar, Chant, Bells and Vocals) \nClare Fischer (Fender Rhodes Piano) - 7,14 \nTom Coster (Keyboards and Synthesizer) \nSaunders King (Rhythm Guitar and Lead Vocals) \nArmando Peraza (Percussion and Vocals) \nGraham Lear (Drums and Timbales) \nPete Escovedo (Percussion) - 6 \nChris Rhyne (Keyboards) \nUrmila Santana (Voice) - 14 \nChris Solberg (Guitar, Keyboards and Vocals) - 5,11 \nDavid Margen (Bass Guitar) \nBob Levy (Synthesizer) - 6 \nNarada Michael Walden (Piano and Hammond Organ) - 9,15 \nGreg Walker (Vocals) - 1,7,11,13 \nRaul Rekow (Percussion) \n\nSilver Dreams &amp; Golden Realities Tracks:\n01  The Chosen Hour (Carlos Santana) 0:35 \n02  Arise Awake (Carlos Santana) 2:05 \n03  Light Versus Darkness (Carlos Santana) 0:48 \n04  Jim Jeannie (C.
