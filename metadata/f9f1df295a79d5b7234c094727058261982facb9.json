But when her best friend Shirley introduces her new man, Patterson Cowling, he seems to be a trouble magnet. A casual thief tries to pick his pocket and is found a few days later with his face blown off. A bloody coincidence, or does Patterson Cowling have a past to protect? As the body count rises, and Primavera becomes den mother to an extended golfing family, it seems that homicide is par for the course, and that hazards lie in wait for everyone. Can she save the day, or is the game just too rough?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f1df295a79d5b7234c094727058261982facb9","amp;dn":"As+Easy+as+Murder+-+%5BA+Primavera+Blackstone+Mystery%2C+%233%5D+-+Quint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f1df295a79d5b7234c094727058261982facb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,241,223,41,90,121,213,183,35,76,9,71,39,5,130,97,152,47,172,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
