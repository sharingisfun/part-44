But the application has many more goodies under it's hood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe computer scanning process takes less than a minute, while fixing might exceed 10 minutes, depending on the number of problems and their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the &quot;System Advisor&quot; tab comes with a bunch of useful advices on the way you could improve computer performance. For example: it recommended me during the test to disable administrative share and autorun, thus improving system security on two different fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resource usage section provides an overview over the way your computer resources are being used by the running processes, which means you can easily discover which of the apps need a bigger amount of CPU and memory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the advanced tool tab comes with several new tools such as &quot;Disk CleanUp&quot; and Defrag&quot;, &quot;Duplicate Remover&quot;, System Tweaks&quot;, Service optimizer&quot;, &quot;File Recovery&quot;, File Shredder&quot;, &quot;Internet Booster&quot; and &quot;History Eraser&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVG PC TuneUp works on a reasonable amount of computer resources, although it may eat up your CPU and RAM when you trying to slove some of the detected problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut all in all, this seems to be one of the most efficient tools of it's kind on the marked and it will definitely meet your expectations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09711c639b7b24390533ff624b374c9edb86e43","amp;dn":"AVG+PC+TuneUp+2016+v16.12.1.43164+X86+%26amp%3B+X64+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09711c639b7b24390533ff624b374c9edb86e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,151,17,198,57,183,178,67,144,83,63,246,36,179,116,201,237,184,110,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
