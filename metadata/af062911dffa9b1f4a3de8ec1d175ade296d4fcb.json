Audience recording used to splice in \r\nmissing section during Trampled Underfoot.\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe concert is quite low key and relaxed. Plant mocks the audience \r\nfor their passivity (even saying, off-mike, &quot;Hannover, fucking \r\nhorrible place!&quot; before In The Evening). He even tries to get Bonham \r\nto play Moby Dick to liven the audience (&quot;No way, mate. No way.&quot; Bonzo \r\nsays to Plant). Highlights include All My Love with Jones playing the \r\nkeyboard solo in at the correct tempo (he often plays it too fast on \r\nthis tour). They rhythm section leaves Page unaccompanied at one point \r\nduring the Trampled Underfoot solo sounding very interesting. Since \r\nI've Been Loving You is one of the best versions from this tour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af062911dffa9b1f4a3de8ec1d175ade296d4fcb","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.06.24+Hannover%2C+Germany+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af062911dffa9b1f4a3de8ec1d175ade296d4fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,6,41,17,223,250,155,31,74,61,232,236,29,23,90,222,41,109,79,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
