It discusses biological systems that can be analyzed quantitatively, and how advances in the life sciences have been aided by the knowledge of physical or engineering analysis techniques.\n\nApplicable courses are biophysics and applied physics.\n\n- Provides practical techniques for applying knowledge of physics to the study of living systems\n- Presents material in a straight forward manner requiring very little background in physics or biology\n- Includes many figures, examples and illustrative problems and appendices which provide convenient access to the most important concepts of mechanics, electricity, and optics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48797a999aeac9cfafe5d4d0aea9a7a8bea7af19","amp;dn":"Physics+in+Biology+and+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48797a999aeac9cfafe5d4d0aea9a7a8bea7af19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,121,122,153,154,234,201,207,175,229,212,208,174,169,167,168,190,167,175,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
