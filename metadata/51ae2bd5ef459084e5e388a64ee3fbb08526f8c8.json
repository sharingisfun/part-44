These massive\nwaves can be taller than the biggest skyscraper, travel at the speed of a jet\nplane and when they reach land, rear up and turn into a terrifying wall of\nwater that destroys everything in its path. These unstoppable, uncontrollable\nforces of nature caused the ruin of an entire ancient civilization, may have\nplayed a small part in the demise of the dinosaurs, and in World War II were\nused as a weapon. Yet astonishingly, two men who surfed the tallest wave in\nhistory - half a kilometre high - survived.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA Short Sample is included for evaluation.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ae2bd5ef459084e5e388a64ee3fbb08526f8c8","amp;dn":"10+Things+You+Didn%27t++Know+About+Tsunamis++%28BBC+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ae2bd5ef459084e5e388a64ee3fbb08526f8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,174,43,213,239,69,144,132,229,227,136,166,78,227,251,176,133,38,248,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
