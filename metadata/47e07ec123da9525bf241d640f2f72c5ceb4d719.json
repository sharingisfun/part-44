Instead, \nthe series takes place during a series of high stakes cash games. The minimum buy-in to this game is $100,000. \n\nUnlike tournament poker, the chips involved represent real money. If a player should lose his initial buy-in, that player \nmay rebuy a minimum of $50,000. In addition, players may bring in and use cash instead of casino chips in some situations. \nThere is no ending per se. Time just runs out on that particular episode. Also, unlike other televised poker, blinds and \nantes are constant, which is standard with cash games. On the show, the structure is blinds of $300/$600 with a $100 ante \neach hand. \n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47e07ec123da9525bf241d640f2f72c5ceb4d719","amp;dn":"High.Stakes.Poker.Season.3+-+qredde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47e07ec123da9525bf241d640f2f72c5ceb4d719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,224,126,193,35,218,149,37,191,36,29,100,15,47,114,197,206,180,215,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
