This fleet and gripping film is the first of the early thrillers the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, made during the fertile phase of his career spent at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. Besides affirming Hitchcock's genius, it gave the brilliant Peter Lorre his first English-speaking role, as a slithery villain. With its tension and gallows humor, it's pure Hitchcock, and it set the tone for such films as The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including \nAudio Commentary Featuring Film Historian Philip Kemp\nInterview With Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro\nThe Illustrated Hitchcock - An Extensive Interview With Director Alfred Hitchcock From 1972, Conducted By Journalist Pia Lindstrom and Film Historian William K.
