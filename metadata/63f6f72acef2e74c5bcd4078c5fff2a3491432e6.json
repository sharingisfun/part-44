The band consists of:\nVictor &quot;Voz&quot; Wright: Rhythm Guitar/Lead Vocals\nAndrew &quot;Blue&quot; Sheets: Lead Guitar/Vocals\nRyan Heimbach: Bass/Vocals\nSeth Heimbach: Drums\n\nTheir music could be described as a mix between Stoner Metal, Blues Rock and Jam. Flatted Fifth has a following of loyal fans and are well received at most types of events, although they prefer more adult-oriented venues. They offer and take pride in their original music, but also try to play covers that are outside the bounds of what is normally heard.\n\nIn 2008 they released their EP &quot;Nobody Nose&quot; with great praise and was even featured in the jukebox of the historic Lew Wallace Tavern. They have also been featured guests on Thunder 103.9's segment Voice of the Independent Artist.\n\n\n\n\nGo To Artist Page\t\n\nRecommended if You Like\nQueens of the Stoneage Ween\n\nMore Artists From\nUnited States - Indiana\n\nOther Genres You Will Love\nRock: Hard Rock Rock: Adult Alternative Pop/Rock Moods: Mood: Fun\nNot what your looking for?
