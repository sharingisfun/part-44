Yet with its gorgeous string-band arrangements and its heartbreaking tales of home and family, it's so timeless it could just as easily have been released in the '30s as the '90s. By contrast, there's no mistaking which decade DeMent's album, The Way I Should, comes from, with its crossover-country sound and its references to Calvin Klein, MTV, child abuse, &quot;quality time,&quot; and Beavis and Butt-head. Nonetheless DeMent's twangy Arkansas soprano and detail-filled lyrics are as sharply original as ever. DeMent's voice seems to glow on &quot;This Kind of Happy,&quot; a love song co-written with her outspoken admirer, Merle Haggard, and on the prayer-like &quot;Keep Me God.&quot;\nThe introspective scope of DeMent's first two records expands to tackle global topics like religion, sexual abuse and war on the tough-talking The Way I Should Be, a more rock-influenced offering including cameo appearances from Mark Knopfler, Lonnie Mack and Delbert McClinton (who duets on &quot;Trouble&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:366b6463bca23b6e5a9395f5e70d65778461dd67","amp;dn":"Iris+DeMent+-+The+Way+I+Should+%5B1996%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"366b6463bca23b6e5a9395f5e70d65778461dd67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,107,100,99,188,162,59,110,90,147,149,245,231,13,101,119,132,97,221,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
