A talented and diverse crop of singer-songwriters communicates these nuanced feelings through inoffensive, stripped-down rock tracks. Alt-country's Ryan Adams offers a subdued piano-and-acoustic ode to being torn between lovers, chanteuse Chantal Kreviazuk warbles strongly about longing, and country singer Shelby Lynne seduces with a steamy soul number. Other highlights include Andy Stochansky, sounding like Belle and Sebastian fronting Travis; Jude's warm tenor and guitar tones conjuring the best power pop of the 1970s; and Sixpence None the Richer's new track, a beautiful string-laden delicacy. Despite how easy it would be for the sticky topics of desire and love to become sappy, Senior Year largely avoids such pitfalls. Better still, the album rarely sounds bland, coming across instead as a compilation of brainy coffeehouse poetry matched word for word by equally interesting instrumentation. --Annie Zaleski \n\n1.
