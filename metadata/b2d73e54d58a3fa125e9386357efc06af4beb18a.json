Applanet is your one-stop alternative app market.\n\nFamiliar Interface\n\nWhether you are a power user or a new user to the Android O.S., Applanet has a familiar interface like the one found in the Android Market. You can view Apps, Games and which of your existing applications that might have updates available.\n\nShare Your Experience\n\nEach user has the ability to rate and leave a comment about apps that they have downloaded and installed from Applanet. This includes but not limits you to post reasons why you use/enjoy an app, flaws with an app or notify us if the application appears to be out-of-date.\n\n\n\nEnjoy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//////////////    MASTITORRENTS      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n\n\n THE REAL NEW!!!!!
