He&amp;#039;s a grumpy old man basically, he would be Bill Hicks&amp;#039; dad if anybody ever made a stand-up comics&amp;#039; Happy Families game.\n\n\nIf you like this check out his older works such as Class Clown, which are probably floating around on here somewhere.\n\n\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJimmy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed3d25b6f61407c197d1bb97321dbb3466f3ed5b","amp;dn":"George+Carlin%2C+You+Are+All+Diseased+%5BComedy+Album%2C+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed3d25b6f61407c197d1bb97321dbb3466f3ed5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,61,37,182,246,20,7,193,151,209,187,151,50,29,187,52,102,243,237,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
