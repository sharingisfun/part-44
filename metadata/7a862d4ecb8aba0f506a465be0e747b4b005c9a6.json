Romero (Night of the Living Dead) have created a Ã¢â‚¬Å“gripping, creepy, frighteningÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (L.A. Reader) film that Ã¢â‚¬Å“thrills, shocks and works us overÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Los Angeles Times)! Featuring an Ã¢â‚¬Å“intelligent screenplay and first-rate castÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The New York Times), including Oscar winner Timothy Hutton. The Dark Half will keep you captivated to the chilling end.\n\nHorror writer Thad Beaumont (Hutton) hopes to distance himself from his murder novels and from George Stark, the name he has used to anonymously author them. To achieve this, he cooks up a murder of his own: a publicity stunt that should lay Stark to rest forever. But when the people around him are found gruesomely slainÃ¢â‚¬â€œand his own fingerprints dot the crime scenesÃ¢â‚¬â€œBeaumont is dumbfounded until he learns that Stark has taken on a life of his own...and begun a gruesome quest for vengeance.\n\nCompression: Divx\nResolution: 720x480 (NTSC)\nFrame Rate: 30 fps\nData Rate: 4854 Kbps\nAudio Format: MP3\nSampling Rate: 44.1 Khz\nSample Size: 16 bits\nChannels: Stereo\n\nRun Time: 122 minutes\n\n\nSEEDING IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.
