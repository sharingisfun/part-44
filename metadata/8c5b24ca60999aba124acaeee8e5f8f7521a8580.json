Note the multiple choice selection between Karaoke labels on the more popular songs is work in progress and this half of the collection has not been processed as yet.\r\n\r\nThe number of errors, duplications and omissions may be slightly higher from now on.  If you find duplicates, always keep the larger of the two as it will be sampled at the higher quality end, as I am attempting to get rid of all my 128 kbps sample rate karaoke and replace/re rip them at 192 or 320 kbps.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 there is no place for bad audio and 128kbps sample speeds.   You would not rip an MP3 at 128 so why do you think it is OK for Karaoke?????","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5b24ca60999aba124acaeee8e5f8f7521a8580","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+22900","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5b24ca60999aba124acaeee8e5f8f7521a8580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,91,36,202,96,153,154,186,18,74,202,238,232,229,248,247,82,26,133,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
