The sad thing is, they actually go through with it, and things rapidly spiral out of control. The adult acting includes a fine, believable, performance from Karl Malden, as the school bus driver. The non actors, including all of the children, are spectacularly unimpressive. Nevertheless, despite some required &quot;feel good&quot; subplots, the story maintains interest. For those that demand a certain amount of realism in their entertainment, &quot;Vanished Without a Trace&quot; will provide a satisfying viewing experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e1736f7bdbcab53f63c95a44c9e603e2077d84","amp;dn":"Vanished+without+a+trace.1993.%28They%5C%27ve+Taken+Our+Children+The","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e1736f7bdbcab53f63c95a44c9e603e2077d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,225,115,111,123,219,202,181,63,99,201,90,68,201,230,3,226,7,125,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
