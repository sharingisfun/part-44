Track teams deal with fly tipping and pick up dog mess thrown on the tracl, while the MerseyRail revenue inspectors must try to clamp down on ticket evasion while dealing with drunk passengers. In the Welsh Valleys, a line that was closed in the 1960s has been reopened, helping to regenerate the area. Slovakian Lukas finds that his new job as a train guard not only helps him to become a fully-fledged Welshman but also, he admits, a bit of a trainspotter. But not all communities welcome the railway - when Network Rail wants to close a manned level crossing box in a picturesque village and move it up the line for safety reasons, they have to contend with the locals intent on keeping 'their' level crossing-keeper.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6859/therailwaykeepingbritai.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1580 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: average 681 MB\nEncoded by Harry65\nSource: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qsk0j&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qsk0j&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27f08431200adc2fc52d283cd257e581f58d83b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Railway+Keeping+Britain+on+Track+5of6+Railway+on+my+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d27f08431200adc2fc52d283cd257e581f58d83b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,127,8,67,18,0,173,194,252,82,210,131,205,37,126,88,31,88,216,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
