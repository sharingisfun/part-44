Scheele Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«Memory Supercharger ParaliminalÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nLearning Strategies Corporation | ASIN: B000TBRK6C | FLAC | 117 Mb\n\n\nImprove your memory instantly\n\nSharpen your ability to remember facts, principles, details, and theories. Listen to this CD to develop your ability to concentrate on reading or dialogue. Remember what you read, hear, and see. Sharpen your memory and hone your ability to use your brain. On sluggish days, this CD can be a lifesaver. Students of any age: improve your test score immediately!\n\nA favorite of PhotoReaders!\n\nYou can improve your memory without having to resort to cumbersome mental processes\n\nDid you know your memory capacity is literally infinite?\n\nWhen relaxed and trusting of your inner mind, you can efficiently use your vast and naturally perfect memory core. If you force yourself to remember, you can block or repress what you want to remember.\n\nWith the Memory Supercharger you will learn to remember more by trusting and letting go. The more trusting you are, the more you will be able to respond in times of need. You will also reduce blocks and improve concentration.\n\nWhen you receive your Memory Supercharger CD, listen daily for a week. For continued improvement, listen on a regular basis depending on your needs. Some people may need to listen daily, others weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\n\nOne customer listens about four times a year, which is about as often as he begins not-remembering things. Sometimes it is where he put his car keys. Other times it is a birthday, or a clientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name, or a task he delegatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ When he notices his memory slippingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or when the staff starts complainingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he listens to the Memory Supercharger. He finds himself right back on top of things with an incredibly memory.\n\nThe mother of a customer complained how she forgot so much. It became a family joke. &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell mom because she wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t remember. Tell dad.&quot; After a couple of months of periodic listening one of her sisters telephoned saying, &quot;Have you noticed how mom isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forgetting everything any more?&quot;\n\nA customer in our office building commented, &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m even remembering who starred in movies years ago.&quot;\n\nThis CD is so powerful that it is part of the PhotoReading Personal Learning Course.\n\nThe CD is ideal for students. We recommend using the Memory Supercharger to enhanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but not replaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½studying. Students say they get the best results when they listen to the CD before they go to bed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd174141ac95e2fae7f5cdff52f790a2b05c72e","amp;dn":"Memory+Supercharger++%5B+Improve+your+memory+instantly+%5D+++-+Paul+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd174141ac95e2fae7f5cdff52f790a2b05c72e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,209,116,20,26,201,94,47,174,127,92,223,245,47,121,10,43,5,199,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
