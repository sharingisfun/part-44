It does NOT include Chapters 10 &amp; 11 on Boundary Value Problems. (May upload if I find those too)\n\n\nThe only difference between this book and previous editions is random problems moved around, new problems added, and a couple sections switched spots back in the 7th edition. THE MATH HAS BEEN THE SAME FOR DECADES. \n\nSo fuck these guys, enjoy your book. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca47b8b09641393c623fe8985b373630ec9a29de","amp;dn":"Boyce+DiPrima+10th+Ed.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca47b8b09641393c623fe8985b373630ec9a29de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,71,184,176,150,65,57,60,98,63,232,152,91,55,54,48,236,154,41,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
