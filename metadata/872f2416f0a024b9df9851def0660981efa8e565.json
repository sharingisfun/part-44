Spartacus\nWas Spartacus the dimple-chinned freedom fighter of that famous movie? We take a look at Spartacus as he really was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a brilliant leader of a guerrilla band, but also a flawed and indecisive human being.\n\nEpisode 02.

Shogun\nTokugawa Ieyasu is the towering figure of Japanese history. He is Oliver Cromwell, Richard The Lionheart and Alfred The Great combined ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the man who overthrew the governing dynasty of Japan and established a regime that would last for centuries.\n\nEpisode 04. Richard the Lionheart\nWas Richard the Lionheart a heroic warrior, noble and wise?
