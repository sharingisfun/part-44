That was a list of what's not included, here we go:\n\n    frames per seconds (a LOT)\n    8 games modes (2 of which must be unlocked)\n    8 unlockable ships with offensive defense (bullets shot in every direction when hit).\n    a campaign, with 3 level of difficulties and boss fights\n    online scores, with replays\n    awesome music\n    XPERIA PLAY Optimized\n\nNotes:\n\n    On older devices kill as many background app you can, this can considerably increase the smoothness.\n    Seriously, kill them all.\n    On some devices (such as the Nexus One) the touch screen has trouble handling touches on the same horizontal or vertical axis. That is why by default the joysticks are in diagonal. You can try moving the joysticks to the bottom using the settings menu, but it might result in poor controls.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 17, 2012 )\n\n    Xperia Play hack to use the right buttons removed as it was causing too much problems. That means that:\n    The back button should now correctly work for everybody.\n    Sound effects (for Android 2.3 and up) ! You have to enable them in the settings menu if you are updating PewPew.\n    ICS support.\n    Removed the on-screen button to quit/pause.\n    Should now work on all the CPUs (ARM/Mips/x86).\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:450e237be1e43cf20a594adf940b8898d22cbde9","amp;dn":"PewPew+2+v1.9.1+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"450e237be1e43cf20a594adf940b8898d22cbde9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,14,35,123,225,228,60,242,10,89,74,223,148,11,136,152,210,44,189,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
