I download so much that I figured it was time to contribute so I found these elsewhere but not on my favorite torrent site Piratebay so I thought I\\\\\\'d share the love.\n\nThis is the Legion of Superheroes cartoon Season 2! \n\nYou can get Season 1 here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6887855/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_Cartoon_Season_1_.avi_OneStopGeekShop\n\nWiki says:\n\nSeason Two has a much more darker and more mature tone then the Season 1 and mostly focuses on Brainiac 5 and his evil ancestor, Brainiac 1.0's relationship, and how Brainiac 5 had always been hiding all the information about his destiny and his ancestor all the years being a Legionnaire, but then eventually reveals all the information to Superman and the others in the same episode (&quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;; at the end of the episode, Brainy erases the episode from Superman's memory). Chameleon Boy appears more often in Season Two than Season One. In Season Two, most of the Legionnaires have changed their appearances, e.g., Lightning Lad has longer hair and gets a robotic arm. Their appearance changed based on the 2-years without Superman (after Superman left in the episode &quot;Sundown Pt.2&quot;, which is the finale of Season One). Triplicate Girl changes her codename into Duo Damsel because one of the bodies (the White Body) is lost in a temporal anomaly during one of their 41st Century's battles, but eventually the White Body returned to the 31st Century, alive and unhurt, when the timeline was restored, and while Kell-El (or Superman X) was reciting the Legionnaire Oath.\nAccording to a KidsWB press release,[5] &quot;the second season of Legion of Super Heroes finds the group fulfilling their collective destiny, each member elevating his/her skills to new levels... just in time to face even greater challenges. A incomprehensibly undefeatable nemesis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Imperiex, the destroyer of galaxies from the rich annals of DC Comics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ puts the Legion into action alongside new team members. Superman returns from the 21st century with greater development of both his physical prowess and far better utilization of his powers to help the Legion toward victory in the 31st century and beyond. Moreover, the Legion finds a surprising, new ally from across the space-time continuum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a 41st century Superman, later called Kell-El, cloned using a combination of the original Superman's DNA and Kryptonite, making him as powerful as Superman while being invulnerable to green kryptonite; to assist in its efforts to rid the universe of this powerful foe. Along the way, the LSH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ including new members like Chameleon Boy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides the perfect complement of heroics and comedy to the efforts of the Supermen.&quot;\nSeason Two takes place approximately two years after the Season One finale. The series logo was also slightly revised.[6] As with Season One, a total of 13 episodes were created for Season Two, which premiered on September 22, 2007. Warner Bros. has confirmed that the second season will also be the last for the show.[1]\n\nFiles are: 23/fps\n\nI dont have the file list thing down so check out the wiki for season 2 episode list included\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Super_Heroes_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can check out my blog at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448c63964a19b32d62d308d4fd39cb8e820925f0","amp;dn":"Legion+of+Super+Heroes+Cartoon+Season+2+.avi+OneStopGeekShop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448c63964a19b32d62d308d4fd39cb8e820925f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,140,99,150,74,25,179,45,98,211,8,212,253,57,203,142,130,9,37,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
