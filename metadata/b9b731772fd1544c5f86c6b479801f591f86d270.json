Uncovered this audio found years ago on suprnova - might have been put together by the Tube Bar prankster (Jim Davidson). Sorry, don't know the original track names - if there are any. Tracks 2 and 4 aren't phone calls but the latter is definitely a good name for a band.  Tracks 1 and 6 are the real deal though!\n\n128k stereo mp3 \nTrack 1 - Red's Tube Bar (24:53)  \nTrack 2 - sound of an extended shit (3:29)  \nTrack 3 - Calling some other guy (5:38)  \nTrack 4 - Traveling Dingleberries ? (49 secs)  \nTrack 5 - Calling a foul-mouthed woman (3:39)  \nTrack 6 - More Tube Bar (11:16)  \nTotal: 49:44  \n\nThanks to the original uploader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b731772fd1544c5f86c6b479801f591f86d270","amp;dn":"Reds+Tube+Bar+%28Bum+Bar+Bastards%29+prank+calls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b731772fd1544c5f86c6b479801f591f86d270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,183,49,119,47,209,84,76,95,134,198,180,121,128,31,89,31,134,210,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
