Volumes 1&amp;2 (Fire &amp; Water), released in October of last\n   year, were met with tremendous critical acclaim and fanfare. Fans and critics\n   were especially impressed with the Water side and just how far the band had\n   pushed the parameters of what they can do as professional musicians. The Ear\n   and Air series show two more sides of the band that anyone has yet to see.\n   The Earth side will showcase a more stripped down, raw element of the band,\n   while Air will expose a more soft rock side. One thing is for certain...no\n   one really knows where Thrice&amp;#039;s music is going, and their fans seem to like\n   it just fine that way.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
