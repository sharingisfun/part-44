Artists like Bill Mounce, the Bar X Cowboys, Modern Mountaineers, the Dixie Ramblers, and \nthe Sons of Dixie may not be household names by any stretch of the imagination (although names like \nBob Dunn, Leon Payne, Tiny Moore, Jimmy Wyble, Moon Mullican, and Cliff Bruner show up on these sides), \nbut the music is top-notch, unfettered by commercial restraints, local music with a free and wild spirit. \nLoads of steel playing, twin fiddles and swinging rhythm sections coupled with jaunty vocals make these \nold Bluebird 78s come to life. Decent transfers of the material and extensive liner notes make this a \npackage well worth the extra effort to find.\n\n-- Cub Koda\n________________________________________\n\n\nRipped with : \n\nEAC 1.0b2\nSecure Mode\nTest &amp; Copy\nFlac 8\n\nAll artwork is also included \nin 600 dpi scans in PNG\n\n________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4adf70e6e6a225e14e5be2066c06e241d0ab72c8","amp;dn":"Jitterbug+Jive+-+Hot+Texas+Swing+1940-1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4adf70e6e6a225e14e5be2066c06e241d0ab72c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,223,112,230,230,162,37,225,78,91,226,6,108,6,226,65,208,171,114,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
