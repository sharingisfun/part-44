The kids boarding at Mulberry are not brain-damaged, and many are very bright. Yet their extreme behavioral problems ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ often caused by emotional trauma and including violent outbursts, agitation and verbal abuse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have gotten them excluded from other schools and institutions and made their familiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lives intolerable. \n\nVariety describes it as a film &quot;mixing ferocity with tenderness, delicacy with tenacity&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ exactly like the unusual school it explores. In Hold Me Tight, Let Me Go, one of Britain's leading documentary filmmakers takes a vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© look at Oxford's Mulberry Bush School for emotionally disturbed children. Mulberry's heroically forbearing staff greets extreme, sometimes violent behavior with only consolation and gentle restraint. Kim Longinotto's unblinking camera captures an arduous process and a nearly unhinged environment, but it also records the daily dramas of troubled kids trying to survive and the moments of hope they achieve with Mulberry's clear-eyed staff.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 699 MiB for 1h 24mn 16s 957ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 009 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps VBR\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb003accdc6bc8aa8610e37597c1dedf5de199ea","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+-+Hold+Me+Tight%2C+Let+Me+Go.07.28.2009.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb003accdc6bc8aa8610e37597c1dedf5de199ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,0,58,204,220,107,200,170,134,16,227,117,151,193,222,223,93,225,153,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
