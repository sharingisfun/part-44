SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been too successful forgetting. The last vestiges of her family hung by a thread in her transformed brain and drove her to be reckless. Ten years later, Eleanor hides in plain sight. She is an average girl getting average grades in a small Wyoming town: poor but happy, lonely but loved. Her mother, Tabitha, is there for her and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever needed. But now her mother is sick and David has returned. The only friend sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever had, the only other person who knows her secret, is back. And Eleanor again becomes reckless. \n\nEleanor is a modest girl, unremarkable but extraordinary, young but old, malleable but fixed. She is scared and confused. She is a liar and a thief. Eleanor is not what she appears to be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b62d157f4531b0562a29fd380a6b9d74226bfaa","amp;dn":"Eleanor+%5BThe+Unseen+01%5D+by+Johnny+Worthen+-+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b62d157f4531b0562a29fd380a6b9d74226bfaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,98,209,87,244,83,27,5,98,162,159,211,128,166,185,215,66,38,191,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
