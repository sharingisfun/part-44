During that time, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader, Velvet Black, has managed to establish a state of martial law throughput the City. But it has come at a high cost, for HotachiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former employers are now allied with their own greatest enemy, Dr. Arkoff. The goal of this unholy union is the creation of a new, invincible army of clones, an immortal master race. So far, the only resistance to SplinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s takeover has been the rebel Black Dove faction, an underground network of freedom fighters. But without Hotachi, without a champion for their forces, and the citizens, to rally around, Black Dove doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand a chance.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0185f310ea2258c3b35961be501a35f19a7c2557","amp;dn":"Samurai+%281988%29+Vol.+3+Barry+Blair+Aircel+Comics+%5Bcomplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0185f310ea2258c3b35961be501a35f19a7c2557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,133,243,16,234,34,88,195,179,89,97,190,80,26,53,241,154,124,37,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
