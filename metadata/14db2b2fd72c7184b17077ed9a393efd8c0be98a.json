Use at own risk! \n\n\nNobody is perfect and Android neither. \n\nApps you have already deleted, sometimes leave data behind. \n\nThe system constantly creates logs, crash reports and debug files you don't really need. \n\nThe market leaves temporary files of downloaded apps behind. \n\nLets not go on here... \n\nWhy not get a maid to clean it all up? SD maid will help you keep your device neat, \n\nclean and tidy for you Smile! \n\nChoose a tab, press check and then either click a single item to delete or press \n\nthe clean all button. It's just that easy. \n\nThe explorer is a full fledged file-manager, use it to crawl through your Androids \nfiles. \n\nYou can use the searcher to open/delete or rename files (wildcards are supported as \n\nis searching inside files). \n\nThe corpse finder searches your device for dormant directories and compares those \n\nto the list of installed applications. \n\nApp Control lets you freeze,reset and remove applications (even system apps). \n\nThe system cleaner scans the devices known directories with unnecessary files. \n\nYou can optimize and shrink bloated databases to speed up access and free space. \n\nView your biggest files and find out what is hogging all the space. \n \n\nSD Maid is constantly being developed and is designed very carefully. \n\nDue to the vast amount of android devices it might not work perfectly on everyone's \n\ndevice, \n\ncleaner,system cleaner,system cleaner,cache cleaner,file removal,explorer,search \n\ntool,empty directories,duplicate files,ccleaner,darken,dark3n,freeze,remove system \n\napps,remove preinstalled,remove,uninstall system apps,delete apps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14db2b2fd72c7184b17077ed9a393efd8c0be98a","amp;dn":"SD.Maid.Pro.System.Cleaning.Tool.2.0.2.3.Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14db2b2fd72c7184b17077ed9a393efd8c0be98a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,219,43,47,215,44,113,132,177,112,119,237,154,57,62,253,140,11,233,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
