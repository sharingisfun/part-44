But will they write ANY essay you request? Only the WORST of these horrible companies were employed in the composition of 'Mindsploitation.' A GREAT DEAL of money was wasted ACROSS THE GLOBE to commission what may be the dumbest collection of ridiculous assignments in HUMAN HISTORY.\n\nWhat does it say about our society that we can buy a quick custom eulogy for our grandmother, or pay to have a love poem for a mistress prepared by a stranger at the click of a button? How entitled is a culture that keeps these services afloat? 'Mindsploitation' uses such questions as a launching pad for wildly entertaining comedic exchanges. The 50 assignments in this book hilariously explore self-help, spirituality, family, health, diet, pop culture, love, and more.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bfe5218c3cbfa03dcc00ff357cade9f9c022873","amp;dn":"Vernon+Chatman+-+Mindsploitation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bfe5218c3cbfa03dcc00ff357cade9f9c022873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,254,82,24,195,203,250,3,220,192,15,243,87,202,222,159,156,2,40,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
