Patterson, in his introduction, talks about the &quot;intensity of emotions&quot; that thrillers shareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as &quot;the force with which they hurtle the reader along.&quot; This description fits such fine efforts as Gayle Lynds's &quot;The Hunt for Dmitri,&quot; which takes the heroine of The Coil, Liz Sansborough, into an adventure involving her father, the infamous CIA assassin known as the Carnivore. But other extremely readable stories, like Alex Kava's &quot;Goodnight, Sweet Mother,&quot; would qualify as straight mystery. Readers who favor one category or another may at first be a bit baffled, but lovers of crime fiction in general and well-told action tales in particular will be well rewarded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a8bf39845b08a629fa0c2dce046956b6b62fa4e","amp;dn":"Thriller+-+Stories+to+Keep+You+Up+All+Night+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a8bf39845b08a629fa0c2dce046956b6b62fa4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,139,243,152,69,176,138,98,159,160,194,220,224,70,149,107,107,98,250,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
