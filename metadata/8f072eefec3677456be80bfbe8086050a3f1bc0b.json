Removed Xenom boot screen. This release fixes any freezing issues after customization as well as freezing during gameplay. If you have ANY issues, leave 'em in the comment box and I'll try to resolve them for you. This was tested using an AceKard2i running Akaio 1.7 (Updated loader) but should work for most flash cards.
