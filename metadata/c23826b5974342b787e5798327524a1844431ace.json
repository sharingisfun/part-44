It's one of several vignettes of Palestinian life in Israel - in a neighborhood in Nazareth and at Al-Ram checkpoint in East Jerusalem. Most of the stories are droll, some absurd, one is mythic and fanciful; few words are spoken. A man who goes through his mail methodically each morning has a heart attack. His son visits him in hospital. The son regularly meets a woman at Al-Ram; they sit in a car, hands caressing. Once, she defies Israeli guards at the checkpoint; later, Ninja-like, she takes on soldiers at a target range. A red balloon floats free overhead. Neighbors toss garbage over walls. Life goes on until it doesn't. \n\nLanguges: Arabic / Hebrew / English\n\nSubtitles srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23826b5974342b787e5798327524a1844431ace","amp;dn":"Divine+Intervention+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23826b5974342b787e5798327524a1844431ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,56,38,181,151,67,66,183,135,229,121,131,39,82,74,24,68,67,26,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
