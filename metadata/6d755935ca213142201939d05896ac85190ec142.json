Alexander Nevsky and Lieutenant Kije are both movie soundtrack works from the 1930s. (Nevsky was a collaboration with Eisenstein!) You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find better recorded performances of these works than here. The Montreal Symphony Orchestra and Choir (along with mezzo-soprano Jard van Nes) under the direction of Charles Dutoit sound magnificent.\n\nI'm sure you'll enjoy this recording.\n\nMP3 @ 320\n\n[NB: I think that several bars of music starting at 4:42 of track 5 were later repurposed for the soundtrack of Wrath of Khan!]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d755935ca213142201939d05896ac85190ec142","amp;dn":"Pokofiev+-+Alexander+Nevsky+-+Dutoit%2C+MSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d755935ca213142201939d05896ac85190ec142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,117,89,53,202,33,49,66,32,25,57,208,88,150,172,133,25,14,193,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
