As I kept editing these songs, there\nwas no way they could've fit on only 2cd's. (Plan was, 1cd 'Original Darkness Mixes', other cd of various outtakes)\nThen next thing I noticed, I had planned a 6cd set with 2cd's of Live tracks... In the end I decided not to\ninclude the live cd's which made this 'only' a 67 track, 4cd collection. I used John's 'brucebase' website (link somewhere below)\nas a database to see which tracks were 'worth' editing, where I could find them and so on.\n\nMaking this a 4cd set allowed me to include some of the tracks I would've otherwise left out, such as the alternative\n'Dont Look Back' &amp; 'Ramrod' which are both in a bit worse sound quality. I wouldn't say any of the tracks sound 'bad'.\n\nWhen burning this compilation, make sure you burn it DAO - without the 2 seconds gaps between each track.\n\nMy favourite tracks: D3Track01 &amp; D3Track16.\n\nBig thanks to FrankiesJoint &amp; Jumpstone for finding me most of the tracks.\n\nBrucebase 'On The Tracks': http://brucebase.org.uk/0.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f1d13c4a73b0202585d340e213aa14853f5b26","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+AMERICAN+MADNESS+-+Remastered+Darkness+On+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f1d13c4a73b0202585d340e213aa14853f5b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,241,209,60,74,115,176,32,37,133,211,64,226,19,170,20,133,63,91,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
