It is a &quot;must see&quot; for all evangelical Christians.&quot; Dr. Cortez Cooper, former head of the MNA for the Presbyterian Church in America\n\nJust what is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCalvinism?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Does this teaching make man a deterministic robot and God the author of sin? What about free will? If the church accepts Calvinism, wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t evangelism be stifled, perhaps even extinguished? How can we balance GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sovereignty and manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s responsibility? What are the differences between historic Calvinism and hyper-Calvinism? Why did men like Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Spurgeon, Whitefield, Edwards and a host of renowned Protestant evangelists deny the Arminian definition of free will and label it heresy? Why did the Roman Catholic Church condemn the Reformed teaching of predestination and election and embrace free will theology? And why do so many Protestants, perhaps unwittingly, agree with Rome on this issue?\n\nAmazing Grace ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The History and Theology of Calvinism is the first video documentary that answers these and other related questions. This fascinating three-part, four-hour presentation is detailed enough so as to not gloss over the controversy. At the same time, it is broken up into ten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSunday-school-sizedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sections to make the rich content manageable and accessible for the average viewer.\n\nRich in graphics, dramatic vignettes, and biblical analogies, Amazing Grace ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The History and Theology of Calvinism also features many of the finest reformed thinkers and pastors of our time: Dr. R.C. Sproul, Dr. D. James Kennedy, Dr. George Grant, Dr. Stephen Mansfield, Dr. Thomas Ascol, Dr. Thomas Nettles, Dr. Roger Schultz, Pastor Walt Chantry, Dr. Joe Morecraft, Dr. Ken Talbot, Pastor Walter Bowie and Dr. R.C. Sproul, Jr..\n\n35,000 copies in circulation.  Come learn what the great Baptist preacher C.H. Spurgeon meant when he said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦to deny Calvinism is to deny the gospel of Jesus Christ.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope some of you out there will enjoy this torrent. This is my first attempt so please bear with me.\n\nContainer - MKV\nVideo - H.264\nAudio - Vorbis\nNumber of disks - 2\nLanguage - English\nSubtitles - None\n\nThis file plays wonderfully with VLC. I put it in MKV to preserve the chapter places. Makes for easier viewing. \n\nA note on content. If you don't agree with it, you don't have to download it. Do not download just to try to pick it to pieces. This is the historic position of the historic Christian church, like it or not. Independent study will prove that. Irregardless, I'm not going to get into a big religious debate over this torrent. If you enjoy it, praise God. If you don't, you don't have to watch. \n\nSola Deo Gloria.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://apologeticsgroup.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://apologeticsgroup.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9d235bcee44e29d63045c4b62aba8b72c16beb","amp;dn":"AMAZING+GRACE%3A+THE+HISTORY+%26+THEOLOGY+OF+CALVINISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9d235bcee44e29d63045c4b62aba8b72c16beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,157,35,91,206,228,78,41,214,48,69,196,182,42,186,139,114,193,107,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
