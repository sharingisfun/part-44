But then one cold winter night she pushed things too far, and her naked frozen body is found in the sub-zero temperatures at the end of the Portland Fish Pier.\n\nThe only witness to the crime: a mentally disturbed young woman named Abby Quinn who mysteriously disappears the very same night.\n\nWith the discovery of Lainie Goff Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s body and the disappearance of Abby Quinn, Portland homicide detective Michael McCabe finds himself on the trail of a relentless and clever killer. A killer he must find before another life is lost.\n\nWith The Chill of Night James Hayman returns to tell a gripping tale of evil and deceit and creates characters so real and so human, we want to meet them again and again.\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b50a4c31e53c585fd8ce8f914faa2d123b010be","amp;dn":"The+Chill+of+Night+by+James+Hayman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b50a4c31e53c585fd8ce8f914faa2d123b010be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,80,164,195,30,83,197,133,253,140,232,249,20,250,162,209,35,176,16,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
