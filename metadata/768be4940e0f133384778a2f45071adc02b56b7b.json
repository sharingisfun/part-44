If you like solo classical guitar of the supremely virtuosic sort, add that into the equation (plus a few excellent duets). These pieces are played with an uncanny rhythmic precision that does not sound mechanical. They are played elegantly, feeling neither overstated nor understated. It is impossible to do justice to this beautiful recording with mere words. It is among my favorite recordings of all time - I never tire of listening to it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768be4940e0f133384778a2f45071adc02b56b7b","amp;dn":"John+Williams+-+El+Diablo+Suelto+%28Classical+guitar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768be4940e0f133384778a2f45071adc02b56b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,139,228,148,14,15,19,51,132,119,138,47,69,7,26,220,2,181,107,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
