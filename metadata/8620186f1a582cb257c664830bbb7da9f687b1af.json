According to a press release, the follow-up to 2009's &quot;Painstained&quot; &quot;presents a rejuvenated, supercharged contemporary melodic metal group with ten impeccably written scorching hot rock anthems for you to bang you head to.&quot;\r\n\r\nENTWINE drummer Aksu Hanttu spent much of the pause expanding his CV and honing his skills as one of the top metal producers in Finland, in preparation for the kaleidoscope of sound and tour de force of dynamics that became &quot;Chaotic Nation&quot;.\r\n\r\nHanttu's sturdy drum beats and producer's hand-print shine all over the band's new outing, but none of it would've come to fruition without a bunch of killer songs. It is guitarist Tom Mikkola's renewed vision and fresh angles to song-writing that laid the brickwork for what resulted to Entwine's strongest outing to date. The icing on the cake is Mika Tauriainen's uniquely emotive voice and thoughtful lyrics, crowning a solidly played, melody-oriented work chock-full of dexterous compositions and catchy hooks.\r\n\r\n&quot;Chaotic Nation&quot; track listing:\r\n\r\n01. End Of Silence\r\n02. Saint Of Sorrow\r\n03. Fortune Falls\r\n04. Plastic World\r\n05. As We Arise\r\n06. Lost, But Still Alive\r\n07. Adrenalize\r\n08. The Evil Lives In The Shadows\r\n09.
