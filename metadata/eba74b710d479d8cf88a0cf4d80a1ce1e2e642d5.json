Find instruments, effects, kits, sounds, and samples fast with the spectacular tag-based visual browser Ã¢â‚¬â€œ optimized for KOMPLETE Instruments and Effects.

(ie. Sound one is always on MIDI channel one, sound two is always on MIDI channel two, sound three is always on MIDI channel three and so on, even if the group contains sounds with no MIDI.)\nKomplete Kontrol Keyboards can now be connected to a Maschine instance using a toolbar icon.\nMIDI input options have changed. &quot;None&quot; now actually means none (ie. no MIDI input even if the sound is in focus), and a new &quot;Focus&quot; entry has been added which allows MIDI input only when the sound is focused.\nScene changes can now be recorded in the DAW.\nIt is now possible to navigate between plugin slots when in the browser by pressing SHIFT.\nA timer has been added to the page numbers on the Maschine classic HW, meaning that the page number no longer blocks the display of sections names.\nMacros and plugin parameters can now be cut and pasted between pages, as well as renamed.\nPlugin pages can now be cleared and deleted.\nEvents can now be quantized from the software (using the right click context menu in the pattern area)\nRoot note is automatically selected when slicing sounds to a new group (partial fix for a bug introduced in 2.2)\nNIS roundtrip (saving presets in KK will update Maschine and the standalone version of the plugins browser with the preset)\n\nNEW INSTRUMENTS AND EFFECTS:\nA new &quot;Analog&quot; mode has been added to the distortion module (based on the Skreamer module in Guitar Rig). The old distortion is the &quot;Mulholland&quot; mode.\nA new Cabient Emulation effect has been added (based on control room from Guitar Rig)\nA new &quot;Breaker&quot; engine has been added to the snare drumsynth.\nA new &quot;High&quot; engine has been added to the Tom drumsynth.\nA new &quot;Cymbal&quot; drumsynth has been added, with two modes &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Ride&quot;.\nA new &quot;Hybrid&quot; engine has been added to the Hi-Hat module.\nThe limiter has been updated. The old limiter is available as a &quot;Legacy&quot; mode.\nTwo new reverb modes have been added &quot;Hall&quot; and &quot;Room&quot;. The plate reverb has been moved, so it is in the reverb module. The old reverb has been renamed as &quot;Reverb (Legacy)&quot;\n\nSHARED CHANGES FROM KOMPLETE KONTROL 1.1\nPluginHost refactoring\nArp Hold added\nScale Key Mode &quot;Guide&quot;\nMaster/Sound Volume Control added\nOctave Display added\nTouchstrip Modes &quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot; and &quot;Stepped&quot;\nTouchstrip Controller Page added\nKontakt Key Switch String Display\nFoldable Tag Clouds functionality added\nCommon Abbreviations Update\n\n\nMASCHINE 2.3 also includes KOMPLETE SELECT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a premium selection of instruments and effects (free for all registered MASCHINE 2 software users):\nMASSIVE - definitive synth for basses and leads\nMONARK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ iconic monophonic syntheisizer\nTHE GENTLEMANÃ¢â‚¬â€œ vintage upright piano\nDRUMLAB Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic and electronic drums\nREAKTOR PRISM Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vibrant modal synth and effects\nSCARBEE MARK I Ã¢â‚¬â€œ classic electric piano\nRETRO MACHINES Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vintage analog synth and keyboards\nVINTAGE ORGANS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ five drawbar legends reborn\nWEST AFRICA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ polyrhythmic percussion and melodies\nSOLID BUS COMP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ versatile compressor effect\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n\nWindows 7 or Windows 8 (latest Service Pack, 32/64-bit), Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\nADDITIONAl INFO\n\nSupported Interfaces: Stand-alone, VST, Audio Units, AAX 32 and AAX 64, ASIO, CoreAudio, WASAPI\n\nPlease note: Native 64-bit support for stand-alone and plug-in versions.
