Soon to be captain of his own ship, he is also about to be married to his true love, Mercedes. But suddenly everything turns sour. On the joyous day of his wedding he is arrested and--without a fair trial--condemned to solitary confinement in the miserable Chateau d'If! The charges? Faked! Edmond has been framed by a handful of powerful enemies. But why?\n\nWhile locked away, Edmond learns from another prisoner of a secret treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond concocts a daring and audacious plan: escape and find the treasure! But it is years later--long after Edmond has transformed himself into the Count of Monte Cristo--that his plan for revenge begins to unfold.\n\nDisguised as the wealthy count, Edmond returns to his native land to find his enemies--and make them pay!\n\n\nAuthor: Alexandre Dumas\nPublished: 1845\nLanguage: English\nWordcount: 464,450 / 1321 pg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b93e86a0feeea4fbb4885ff8b7a7ee250ff0bdd","amp;dn":"The+Count+of+Monte+Cristo+by+Alexandre+Dumas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b93e86a0feeea4fbb4885ff8b7a7ee250ff0bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,147,232,106,15,238,234,79,187,72,133,255,139,122,126,226,80,255,11,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
