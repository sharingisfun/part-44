It seems clear to me that she will be a very important part of the popular music scene over the next few decades.\n\nAs it turns out I was able, last week, to upload one of her songs to YouTube &quot;successfully&quot;, however on my second attempt, today, I was served an immediate world-wide blockage (by BBC &quot;World&quot; ironically) and a second strike against the account placing it in the &quot;Bad Standing&quot; category and, of course, disabling most of its features.\n\nWell, that doesn't matter so much for that channel since it's mostly short music clips, and even the super-high resolution videos I uploaded have been seriously degraded, audio-wise. Not a good thing for a &quot;music&quot; channel.\n\nIn fact, come to think of it, YouTube is probably one of, if not *the worst* website(s) to use if you want to upload and deliver high quality audio. The best I've ever seen the site spit back at me is &quot;AAC 192 kbps @ 44.1 KHz&quot;. I have no idea what criteria that &quot;quality&quot; decision is based on. For instance my own lousy videos of me just talking will normally be granted the *maximum* (192...) audio quality, whereas a 448 kbps AC3 (Dolby) with either 2 or 6 channels @ 48 KHz, coupled with 1080p, 16:9 completely lossless video stream, but with the audio being *music*, will typically be regurgitated at nearly the lowest possible quality audio; about ~ 126 kbps AAC @ 44.1 KHz, for a total loss of oh Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ maybe 70% or 80%? \n\nBasically the &quot;fidelity equivalent&quot; of a standard hand-held transistor radio.\n\nI can see that doing something like that, for music particularly, might have been concocted as a kind of &quot;marketing gimmick&quot;, possibly by a retarded person. You know? like &quot;shareware&quot;? where you're given a crippled &quot;sample&quot; of the real thing in the hopes that upon hearing one might go out and buy the *full quality* version(s) at their local store.\n\nOnly a few minor problems with that strategy: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ It sounds so crappy you'd be insane to waste your hard-earned dollars on it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Local stores don't typically sell music videos.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Most YouTube videos *have never*, and *will never* be available for any sort of purchase online or off. There's just so much content variety (especially in &quot;archival&quot; content) on the site that it could not have been created by companies looking to make a profit. The only way all that variety can be explained is as representing of the millions of individuals that have successfully, and against all odds, managed to participate in the hard work of building the site; providing it with all that obscure (and free) content.\n\nSo what might have been (in some alternate universe say) a *tremendous* resource of unfathomable depth and variety has (in this universe), in the realm of audio, become a kind of &quot;world-wide garbage can&quot; hosting the lowest possible junk-audio the site owners get away with.\n\nAnd one thing is clear: Bandwidth is not at issue.\n\nAnyway, I ramble.\n\nSome of the videos here, the ones not marked &quot;WebRip[YT]&quot; come with a companion video containing their full quality Dolby 6 channel audio. I inserted Mp3 audio for those ones because Dolby doesn't work on my system. You can merge the original audio with their corresponding videos using software like avidemux.\n\nThese ones are the &quot;nearly pure audio&quot; avi containers:\n-------------------------------------------------------\ndolby.audio.st.vincent.birth.in.reverse.jools.holland.avi\ndolby.audio.st.vincent.digital.witness.jools.holland.avi\ndolby.audio.st.vincent.prince.johnny.jools.holland.avi\n\nHere are the actual videos:\n--------------------------\nHigh quality both A/V:\n*********************\nSt Vincent - Birth In Reverse.avi\nSt Vincent - Digital Witness.avi\nSt Vincent - Prince Johnny.avi\n\nHigh quality V:\n***************\nSt Vincent &amp; David Byrne (NPR, 2014) - WebRip[YT].avi\nSt Vincent @ Pitchfork Music Festival 2014 - WebRip[YT].avi\nSt Vincent @ KCRW Studios on Sept - WebRip[YT].avi\n\nCrummy, but of historical interest:\n***********************************\nSt Vincent @ Live Letterman - WebRip[YT].avi\nSt Vincent @ Primavera Sound 2014 - WebRip.avi[YT]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:495d41369b7e2563701de7305dae518594e21734","amp;dn":"St.+Vincent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"495d41369b7e2563701de7305dae518594e21734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,93,65,54,155,126,37,99,112,29,231,48,93,174,81,133,148,226,23,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
