The story follows Takashi Komuro, a Japanese student at Fujimi High School who survived the initial outbreak along with several of his classmates and the school nurse, and occasionally jumps to the perspective of other characters.\nThe plot is initially concerned with the cast's physical survival and escape from the titular high school and zombies, but as the series proceeds it introduces the additional threats of societal collapse, in the form of dangerous fellow survivors and the possible decay of the characters' own moral codes.\n\nLots and lots of Fan Service! Quite a nice series if you like blood and gore... and lovely bouncing ladies!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03fc62eb9a1b345cdf8f47b770c998886c958456","amp;dn":"High+School+of+the+Dead+%28manga%29+chapter+1+-+23+%2B+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03fc62eb9a1b345cdf8f47b770c998886c958456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,252,98,235,154,27,52,92,223,143,71,183,112,201,152,136,108,149,132,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
