With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors and baby dolls, Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and violent brand of heavy metal that was designed to shock.[2]\n\nAlice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with 1971's monster hit &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot; from the album Love it to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single &quot;School's Out&quot; in 1972. The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies.\n\nFurnier's solo career as Alice Cooper, adopting the band's name as his own name, began with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. In 2008 he released Along Came a Spider, his 18th solo album. Expanding from his original Detroit rock roots, over the years Cooper has experimented with many different musical styles, including conceptual rock, art rock, hard rock, new wave, pop rock, experimental rock and industrial rock.[3] In recent times he has returned more to his garage rock roots.[4]\n\nAlice Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage, The Rolling Stone Album Guide going so far as to refer to him as the world's most &quot;beloved heavy metal entertainer&quot;.[5] He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and is seen as being the person who &quot;first introduced horror imagery to rock'n'roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre&quot;.[6] Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur and, since 2004, a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper.\n\nOn VH1's &quot;100 Greatest artists of Hard Rock&quot;, Cooper was ranked #20.[7].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlice CooperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Hits 1974\n\n\nAlice Cooper's Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album by Alice Cooper, released in 1974. It features the hit singles and some B-sides of songs from their third album (Love It to Death) to the last album with the band's original lineup (Muscle of Love).\n\nThis compilation's song versions were remixed by Jack Richardson at the time, with the remix of &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot; being released as a single in the US. The reason behind remixing the songs was perhaps to boost its appeal as &quot;new&quot; versions because no new tracks were available for inclusion by the group as they were on hiatus at the time.\n\nThis compilation was expanded upon when, in 2001, Rhino released Mascara &amp; Monsters: The Best of Alice Cooper, which includes the original Single versions of the songs in addition to a number of Cooper's post-1974 hits as a solo artist, filling up the entire CD.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tI'm Eighteen&quot; (Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, Neal Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58 \no\tOriginal version on Love It to Death \n\n\n2.\t&quot;Is It My Body&quot; (Cooper, Buxton, Bruce, Dunaway, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41 \no\tOriginal version on Love It to Death \n\n\n3.\t&quot;Desperado&quot; (Cooper, Bruce) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29 \no\tOriginal version on Killer \n\n\n4.\t&quot;Under My Wheels&quot; (Bruce, Dunaway, Bob Ezrin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46 \no\tOriginal version on Killer \n\n\n5.\t&quot;Be My Lover&quot; (Bruce) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 \no\tOriginal version on Killer \n\n\n6.\t&quot;School's Out&quot; (Cooper, Buxton, Bruce, Dunaway, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30 \no\tOriginal version on School's Out\n\n \n7.\t&quot;Hello, Hooray&quot; (Rolf Kempf) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \no\tOriginal version on Billion Dollar Babies \n\n\n8.\t&quot;Elected&quot; (Cooper, Buxton, Bruce, Dunaway, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \no\tOriginal version on Billion Dollar Babies \n\n\n9.\t&quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; (Cooper, Bruce) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07 \no\tOriginal version on Billion Dollar Babies \n\n\n10.\t&quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; (Cooper, Bruce, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \no\tOriginal version on Billion Dollar Babies \n\n\n11.\t&quot;Teenage Lament '74&quot; (Cooper, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 \no\tOriginal version on Muscle of Love \n\n\n12.\t&quot;Muscle of Love&quot; (Cooper, Bruce) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \no\tOriginal version on Muscle of Love\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2692ae2b72a1a371feea3a765dfc8221f270aea","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper+-+Greatest+Hits+1974+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2692ae2b72a1a371feea3a765dfc8221f270aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,105,42,226,183,42,26,55,31,238,163,167,101,223,200,34,31,39,10,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
