When he finds a hat that bears the initials of a friend that he left during the war when he fled from a detention camp, his sense of guilt becomes a severe paranoia. Beset with inner voices, Jonas strays around the city feeling cornered by the city's high-rises. Even his girlfriend Nanni cannot free him from the agonizing conflict between his past and the present. In his review in &quot;Filmkritik&quot;, Ulrich Gregor remarked that this film &quot;offers more arguments for discussion then all other movie productions of that year in total.&quot;\n\n******************************************************************************\nOriginal Title: Jonas\nReleased: 1957\nEng.
