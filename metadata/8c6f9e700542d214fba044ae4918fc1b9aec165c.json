The Doctor finds himself in the capital city of London, where the population is bewildered and trembling beneath the violent onslaught of a merciless invader.\n\nDespite what the cover says, this torrent does not contain the bonus interview disc. It was hard enough to just track down The Pescatons itself.\n\nThis is the only Tom Baker audio episode, and was not originally recorded for the BBC. His only other in-character radio performance, The Time Machine, was not a doctor who episode at all, but a 19 minute episode of an educational radio series called Exploration Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6f9e700542d214fba044ae4918fc1b9aec165c","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+The+Pescatons+-+Tom+Baker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6f9e700542d214fba044ae4918fc1b9aec165c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,111,158,112,5,66,210,20,251,160,68,174,73,24,252,27,154,236,22,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
