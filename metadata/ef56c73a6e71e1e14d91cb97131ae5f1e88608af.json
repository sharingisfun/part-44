Fuel had their breakthrough in 2001 when &quot;Hemorrage (In My Hands)&quot; became an omnipresent hit on modern rock radio, sending its parent album, Something Like Human, to 17 on the charts. &quot;Hemorrage (In My Hands)&quot; broke through because it had a brutal, endlessly repeated hook that stuck in the head, selling the band's otherwise generic post-grunge. For Natural Selection, the follow-up to Something Like Human, Fuel tone down a bit of the stridency in their sound and clean up their sound a little (not too dissimilar to what Nickelback did with their follow-up album, The Long Road, released on the same day as Natural Selection, strangely enough). Such an increased sense of professionalism combined with a decrease in hooks from songwriter Carl Bell means that Fuel sound even more generic on Natural Selection than they did before. Without hooks from Bell, this relies entirely on sound and feel, and it's too slick to really have the visceral kick or angsty pull that the band intended. It's not awful -- it's professionally performed and recorded -- but it is generic, which ultimately is kind of appropriate.\n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Quarter [03:40] \n 02.Down inside of you [04:08] \n 03.Million miles [03:52] \n 04.Falls on me [04:14] \n 05.These things [04:58] \n 06.Won't back down [03:24] \n (bring you hell remix) \n 07.Running away [04:55] \n 08.Most of all [04:14] \n 09.Getting thru [04:10] \n 10.Die like this [04:30] \n 11.Luck [04:16] \n 12.Days with you [04:30] \n ____ \n \n 50:51 min \n 84,3 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef56c73a6e71e1e14d91cb97131ae5f1e88608af","amp;dn":"Fuel-Natural_Selection-%28Retail%29-2003-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef56c73a6e71e1e14d91cb97131ae5f1e88608af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,86,199,58,110,113,225,225,77,145,203,151,19,26,229,241,232,134,8,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
