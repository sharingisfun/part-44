Imagine hazy memories of hanging with Kraftwerk and Prince as Disney's Main Street Electrical Parade goes by and you're close to the allure of &quot;Stay I'm Changed,&quot; since the bleepy cute soundtracks of the Magic Kingdom's Perrey &amp; Kingsley come to mind throughout this strange journey. \n\n  In their style, a synth imitates a stoned stumble during &quot;Kenny Rolls One,&quot; and the great &quot;Korben Dallas&quot; uses something close to a tennis shoe squeak for its hook, but Lustman isn't strictly out for giggles, as &quot;Straight Arrow&quot; slowly pumps with a well-cooled house beat. Then there's the great flotation experience that &quot;Uncea&quot; offers, along with the thought that FaltyDL is Aphex Twin with no malice, and if Mumford &amp; Sons need a remixer, they only need to listen to the warm sweater of a closer called &quot;Bells&quot; to find their sentimental, nostalgic soulmate. \n\n  If this all sounds too adorable or too Zooey Deschanel, there's a serious respect for funk, groove, house music, and glitch to be found here, plus Lustman was signed to the sometimes difficult Planet Mu label for a spell, so prepare to be challenged, just a touch. Hardcourage is a rich experience that rewards return visits. Add a near perfect flow from start to finish, and this fun bundle of irresistible future garage can be considered crafted, even when the spirit is as easy as Sunday morning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68dac26fa09c57ddccebb8d4de516a71bd343208","amp;dn":"FaltyDL+-+Hardcourage+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68dac26fa09c57ddccebb8d4de516a71bd343208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,218,194,111,160,156,87,221,204,235,184,212,222,81,106,113,189,52,50,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
