The program, hosted by Alan Cross, is syndicated to several other radio stations, mostly but not exclusively Corus-owned, across Canada.\n\nThe Ongoing History chronicles the history of alternative rock, from its roots in punk and new wave to the modern day. An episode of the show may profile an important musician or band (The Sex Pistols, The Smiths, R.E.M., Foo Fighters, The Cure, Nirvana, U2, Nine Inch Nails, The Velvet Underground, etc.), a significant musical trend such as grunge or Madchester, or a theme such as payola, gay musicians or significant cult figures.\n\nSome topics are covered in a single show, while more substantial topics may be presented over two, three or four episodes.\n\n\n   1.
