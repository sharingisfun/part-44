Its basic appeal lay in the VolksgemeinschaftÃ¢â‚¬â€a Ã¢â‚¬Å“peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that appealed to Germans to be part of a great project to redress the wrongs of the Versailles treaty, make the country strong and vital, and rid the body politic of unhealthy elements. The goal was to create a new national and racial self-consciousness among Germans. For Germany to live, othersÃ¢â‚¬â€especially JewsÃ¢â‚¬â€had to die. Diaries and letters reveal GermansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fears, desires, and reservations, while showing how Nazi concepts saturated everyday life. Fritzsche examines the efforts of Germans to adjust to new racial identities, to believe in the necessity of war, to accept the dynamic of unconditional destructionÃ¢â‚¬â€in short, to become Nazis.\n\nPowerful and provocative, Life and Death in the Third Reich is a chilling portrait of how ideology takes hold","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3598d00e7f6289a73e5c998bc9c1232ef93a5cf7","amp;dn":"Life+and+Death+in+the+Third+Reich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3598d00e7f6289a73e5c998bc9c1232ef93a5cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,152,208,14,127,98,137,167,62,92,153,139,201,193,35,46,249,58,92,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
