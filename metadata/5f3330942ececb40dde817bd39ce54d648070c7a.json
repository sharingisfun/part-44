Could it have been better? Possibly but it's such a joy anyway.\n Euripides September 2011\n\nDynamic range analysis:\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Analyzed: Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers / Live At The Lyceum\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n DR Peak RMS Duration Track\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n DR13 -0.09 dB -15.00 dB 4:21 ?-01 Trench Town Rock\n DR13 -0.09 dB -15.45 dB 5:09 ?-02 Burnin and Lootin\n DR13 -0.15 dB -15.27 dB 4:34 ?-03 Them Belly Full\n DR13 -0.13 dB -16.63 dB 4:33 ?-04 Lively Up Yourself\n DR14 -0.41 dB -17.40 dB 7:12 ?-05 No Woman No Cry\n DR13 -0.66 dB -16.00 dB 5:16 ?-06 I Shot The Sheriff\n DR12 -0.09 dB -15.32 dB 6:27 ?-07 Get Up, Stand Up\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Number of tracks: 7\n Official DR value: DR13\n\n Samplerate: 96000 Hz\n Channels: 2\n Bits per sample: 24\n Bitrate: 3013 kbps\n Codec: FLAC\n =======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f3330942ececb40dde817bd39ce54d648070c7a","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Bob+Marley+-+Live%21+At+The+Lyceum+-+1975%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f3330942ececb40dde817bd39ce54d648070c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,51,48,148,46,206,203,64,221,232,23,189,57,206,84,214,72,7,12,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
