Tracks in the torrent were ripped from that 2-CD set at 256kps in mp3 format. Click on Ã¢â‚¬Å“FilesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ above for complete track listing. \n\nDagosto's own analysis: These two albums represent an act that can (when it wishes) rock fairly hard. More often, though, they are gentler pop-rock. They also incorporate a variety of familiar international styles: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nikki Hoi,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for example, is decidedly Hawaiian slack-key sounding, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Carlos and the Bull,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its flamenco guitar stylings, affects a Spanish (or Mexican) flair. The duo could also echo such current influences as progressive rock; witness the suite-like 7-minute-plus Ã¢â‚¬Å“Marmendy Mill.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lighthearted, humorous, and fun-loving, Flo &amp; Eddie were a precursor of later acts such as They Might Be Giants or Barenaked Ladies: serious musicians doing serious music, and more than simply a novelty act doing novelty songs.
