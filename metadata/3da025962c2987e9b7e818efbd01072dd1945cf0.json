EastEnders star Shane Richie travels around his home city of London to explore the history of the Blitz there.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/09/07/2982a748b2db86fc18e5eeae5453451b.jpg[/img]\n\nTo mark the anniversary of the start of the Blitz: Shane Richie, David Harewood, Ricky Tomlinson, John Humphrys and Myleene Klass each visit their hometowns, and with the use of rarely seen target documents compiled by the Nazis, take to the sky to recreate the same bombing routes used by the German Luftwaffe.\n\nThe celebrities then return to land, to look at aerial photography and film taken of their city immediately after it was bombed, and try to gain a better understanding of why their city was targeted. They will also meet with survivors of the Blitz, hear about how they were affected and talk about how they helped to rebuild the nation.  \n\nShane Richie tells how the Blitz began in earnest on the afternoon of 7 September 1940, when the German Luftwaffe filled the skies in the first major daytime raid on the capital.\n\nThe night-time raids that followed were relentless: night after night, for nearly two months, the bombers returned, targeting major landmarks. In the end around one third of the City was laid to waste.\n\nA pilot takes Shane above London, and with the help of an aerial archaeologist they revisit the route which the German bombers would have taken, and explain how the River Thames was used by the enemy to navigate at night.\n\nAfter his flight, Shane visits an air raid shelter with a Blitz survivor who has vivid memories of what is was like as a young girl sitting in the dark whilst bombs were dropping outside. He also returns to one of his old haunts, the Harlesden Working MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s club, where he meets with a group of locals who were small children at the time of the Blitz, who learned to make the best of very challenging circumstances","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3da025962c2987e9b7e818efbd01072dd1945cf0","amp;dn":"Blitz.Cities.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3da025962c2987e9b7e818efbd01072dd1945cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,160,37,150,44,41,135,233,183,232,24,239,189,1,7,45,209,148,92,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
