Peppered with Depression-era nuggets like Bessie Smith\\'s bawdy \\&quot;Need a Little Sugar in My Bowl,\\&quot; Jasper Taylor &amp; His State Street Boys\\' \\&quot;Stomp Time Blues,\\&quot; and Ruth Etting\\'s \\&quot;Button Up Your Overcoat,\\&quot; Water for Elephants, much like the film and novel themselves, dutifully evoke a bygone era. Largely orchestral with flourishes of mandolin and guitar, jazz, cabaret, and vaudeville blues, Howard\\'s lovely and lucid score draws from the realms of fantasy, magical realism, and historical fiction while maintaining a concrete sense of place.\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n\n01 - Did I Miss It\n02 - The Circus Sets Up\n03 - Circus Fantasy\n04 - Jacob Sees Marlena\n05 - Button Up Your Overcoat (Excerpt) (Ruth Etting)\n06 - Prosze, Rosie, dac noge\n07 - Rosie\n08 - Speakeasy Kiss\n09 - I\\'m Confessin\\' (That I Love You)\n10 - Barabra\\'s Tent\n11 - Jacob Returns\n12 - Don\\'t Tell Him What Happened To Me\n13 - Shooting Star\n14 - The Job Is Yours\n15 - I Need a Little Sugar in My Bowl (Bessie Smith)\n16 - Stomp Time Blues (Jasper Taylor &amp; His Statestreet Boys)\n17 - I Can See Straight Through You\n18 - Sanctuary\n19 - Baptism - Jacob &amp; Rosie\n20 - The Stampede - I\\'m Coming Home\n\nSEED AND SHARE!!\n\nCLICK ON MY USERNAME FOR MORE Soundtracks!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:095a9921062c3f3dad5553b4229a7fa63e07d809","amp;dn":"Water+for+Elephants+Soundtrack++%282011%29+-+James+Newton+Howard+%5Blo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"095a9921062c3f3dad5553b4229a7fa63e07d809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,90,153,33,6,44,63,61,173,85,83,180,34,154,127,166,62,7,216,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
