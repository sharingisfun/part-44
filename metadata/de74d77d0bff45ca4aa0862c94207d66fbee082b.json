Among The Living (Acoustic Version)  \n\nIf ever a group's name were wrapped in florid irony, it's surely that of the Thorns. The Thorns is a bright, buoyant summit meeting of contemporary popmeisters Matthew Sweet, Shawn Mullins and Pete Droge. Backed by an all-star studio ensemble that includes Jim Keltner, Greg Leisz, Brendan O'Brien and Roy Bittan, the three nominally insulated musicians do more than claim the legacy of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash on the harmonic riches of &quot;Think It Over&quot; and the glorious &quot;Now I Know&quot;. (It's equally hard to imagine the baby-boom icons wrapping themselves around the chunky funk of the title track here or the pointed impressionistic allegory of &quot;Dragonfly&quot;.) They also find a musical common ground that can't help but echo history in its folk-rooted vocal glories yet forges an ego-sublimating higher ground that's anything but nostalgic. Fans of the three musicians may recognise their various sensibilities at work throughout, but this is a rewarding collaboration that virtually defies deconstruction. Don't be misled by the name--this is a beautiful, accessible, musically fragrant bouquet.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/01/the-thorns/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de74d77d0bff45ca4aa0862c94207d66fbee082b","amp;dn":"The+Thorns...The+Thorns%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de74d77d0bff45ca4aa0862c94207d66fbee082b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,116,215,125,11,255,69,202,74,160,134,44,148,32,125,102,251,238,8,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
