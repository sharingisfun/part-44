Havasupai is a paradise enveloped in one of the earth's most rugged and parched landscapes. The Havasupai Tribe has never advertised its canyon and has never endorsed a guidebook to prepare visitors for a journey into the Heart of the Grand Canyon Ã¢â‚¬â€ until now. Exploring Havasupai is the essential destination guide for those visiting the area. The guidebook is filled with insider tips, fascinating background, and essential information. It identifies many new hikes, mines, springs and historical sites never before revealed in a Grand Canyon or Havasupai guidebook. Details on canyon geology, weather patterns, and the unique flora and fauna add depth to a hiker's experience. Exploring Havasupai includes detailed maps, trail descriptions, stunning full-color photographs, and intriguing historical insights. This is the must-have guide for canyon visitors, whether arriving by helicopter, on horseback, or on foot.\n\n\nBy Greg Witt\nPublished by Menasha Ridge Press in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 208 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594e2ad2446feb5b20a41821e773abf65c580acd","amp;dn":"Exploring+Havasupai++%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594e2ad2446feb5b20a41821e773abf65c580acd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,78,42,210,68,111,235,91,32,164,24,33,231,115,171,246,92,88,10,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
