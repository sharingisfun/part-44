Sure, The Chieftans just cut a record with Bon Iver and The Decemberists, but what about true cross-pollination? WhereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our Celtgaze? And what about Gaelwave? Wherefore art thou, Hip-HopScotch? Dub(lin)step? Get on that, Brooklyn. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start a revolution.\n\nUrstan is one of those collaborations that makes so much sense that you have to wonder why it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come earlier. Alasdair Roberts is a folk singer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been quietly putting out a stream of highly listenable, Celtic-influenced records on Drag City at a fairly prolific rate, even amongst a roster of labelmates that boasts such output-happy artists as Bonnie Ã¢â‚¬Å“PrinceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Billy and Neil Hagerty. Here heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teamed up with singer Mairi Morrison, a Gaelic-speaking Isle of Lewis native, to perform a number of traditional pieces with a few newly penned songs peppered in. Several of the Gaelic-language traditionals are sad-sounding but pretty: Ã¢â‚¬Å“E Ho LeigeinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a stripped-down ballad, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ailein DuinnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ plays out over top a low-pitch dirge. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LÃƒÂ rach do ThacaideanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ presents another side of the coin, an upbeat and jazzy piece featuring finger-plucked guitar and harmonica. The few English-language pieces are easier to sing along with, particularly the catchy cautionary tale Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never Wed an Old ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n\n\nFor Roberts, who was treading dangerously close to diminishing returns with each release, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a record that sounds distinctly different than the last few and should be refreshing to his followers. For Morrison, a relative unknown in the U.S., it could perhaps pave the way to an international audience. She possesses a beautiful, soothing voice, even when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing in a language common to only a handful of small islands. Urstan is worth a plunge, even for listeners new to the musical genre.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20120226 (139.1)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202d232af8da3b85e358a456073e4a29ec659c00","amp;dn":"Mairi+Morrison+%26amp%3B+Alasdair+Roberts...Urstan%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202d232af8da3b85e358a456073e4a29ec659c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,45,35,42,248,218,59,133,227,88,164,86,7,62,74,41,236,101,156,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
