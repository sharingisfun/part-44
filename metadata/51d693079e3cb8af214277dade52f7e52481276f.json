One day, ZenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend discovers a list of debtors in an old notebook, from the days when Zin was a high-interest moneylender under No. 8. In order to get money to pay for her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cancer treatment, Zen decides to collect on the debts, which leads to confrontations with various criminal gangs and, eventually, No. 8.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d693079e3cb8af214277dade52f7e52481276f","amp;dn":"Chocolate.2008.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-ESiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d693079e3cb8af214277dade52f7e52481276f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,214,147,7,158,60,184,175,33,66,119,218,222,82,247,229,36,129,39,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
