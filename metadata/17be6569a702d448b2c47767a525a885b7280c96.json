Haas\n\nruntime  85 mins.\n\nIMDb:  tt0052610\n\nCast \n\nSteve Cochran,\nFay Spain,\nMamie Van Doren, \nRay Danton,\nCathy Crosby,\nBilly Daniels  \nJim Mitchum,\nJackie (Uncle Fester) Coogan,\nVampira\n\ncomplete cast at the credit roll\n\nSummary  from IMDb\n\nA detective is assigned to track down and capture a crazed serial rapist.\n\t\n  My notes\n\n  Another one from the vault and a similar cast list to &quot;The Big Operator&quot; (1959)  starring Mickey Rooney (good availability on the fileshares.)\nI first really saw Steve Cochran in the Don Seigal film &quot;Private Hell 36.&quot;\nHe's played good guys and bad guys and never really got typecast.\n\n  This look back to low budget filmmaking in 1959 leaves the question: Is it a satire on the beatnik fad or a social problems drama?    Certainly the later themes that emerge are serious as they are in &quot;Big Operator&quot; and I save those for the viewer with no spoilers.\n\n   The signature element of a number of these releases is Mamie Van Doren.\nOne day we may see &quot;Girls Town&quot; but WB is not offering it anywhere. She has the billing but Fay Spain is the most sympathetic character.\n\n   Charles F. Haas has a long resume for television direction: he has at least one credit for virtually every one of the series made by WB for tv in the 50's and early 60's.  I remember many of them and would see more released in video sets.\n\nNotes written April 9th, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17be6569a702d448b2c47767a525a885b7280c96","amp;dn":"The+Beat+Generation+starring+Mamie+Van+Doren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17be6569a702d448b2c47767a525a885b7280c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,190,101,105,167,2,212,72,178,196,119,103,165,37,168,133,183,40,12,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
