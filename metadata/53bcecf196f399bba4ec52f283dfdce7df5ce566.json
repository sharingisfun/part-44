Sterling Hayden, Alexis Smith, Ben Cooper\n\n&quot;Very realistically produced film. Difficult, if not impossible to find. Anyone\nwho knows anything about WW2 will appreciate this film and the subject matter.\nIt's in black and white and it's a gem of a classic. A must have for anyone who\nenjoys film based upon fact.&quot;\n\n&quot;One of Republic's most elaborate productions of the 1950's, The Eternal Sea is\nthe biography of American Admiral John M. Hoskins. Sterling Hayden delivers a\nsuperbly understated performance as Hoskins, who continued to serve throughout\nWW2 despite the loss of a leg in the early phases of the conflict. The Admiral's\nfarsighted activities as Commander of the aircraft carrier Princeton led to the\ndevelopment of the more sophisticated jet aircraft carriers of the Korean War.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048047/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048047/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVDRip from an obviously well used and unrestored film print.\n\n1400 MB, 29.970 fps, 01h42m47s\nXviD @ 1641 kbps\nDolby AC3 @ 256 kbps tot, stereo\n512X384, sar 1.333 (4:3)\nEnglish audio, no subtitles\n\n(If you like this check out the recently uploaded &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; from 1960.)\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaphMAADd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OaphMAADd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAphoAadd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/OAphoAadd&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53bcecf196f399bba4ec52f283dfdce7df5ce566","amp;dn":"The+Eternal+Sea+%281955+-+Sterling+Hayden%29%5BWorld+War+II%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53bcecf196f399bba4ec52f283dfdce7df5ce566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,188,236,241,150,243,153,187,164,236,82,242,131,223,220,231,223,92,229,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
