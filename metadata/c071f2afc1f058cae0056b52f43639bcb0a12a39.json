At first the two Voltron teams are at odds and there's some great Voltron vs. Voltron battle action.\n\n\nThird Series: War Path\n\nThis arc concerns a betrayal to the Lion Voltron team as well as how the Voltron Force edges closer to all-out war with the Drules. Vehicle Team is only mildly a part of this arc.\n\n\nFourth Series\n\nActually, the below issue, #11, was issued and it was announced that it would be the last - so the arc ends prematurely I'm afraid.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c071f2afc1f058cae0056b52f43639bcb0a12a39","amp;dn":"Voltron+Volume+2+Devil%27s+Due+Publishing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c071f2afc1f058cae0056b52f43639bcb0a12a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,113,242,175,193,240,88,202,224,5,107,82,244,54,57,188,176,161,42,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
