We make a return trip through the Last Frontier with a second series of Railroad Alaska, chronicling everyday challenges faced by isolated homesteaders living along Alaska's critical railway. The series follows an elite crew who tirelessly work to keep the train rolling 365 days a year in order to deliver life-sustaining supplies to Americans living off the grid and miles away from civilisation. With dedication, tenacity and a bit of grit, these Alaskans have truly mastered the splendour of living life on the track.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Bear Attack \r\nWith time running out, the freight crew struggle to make their delivery to a salvage crew stranded in the wilderness and Jim James returns from town with a huge surprise for his wife Nancy.\r\n\r\n2)  Mountain Danger \r\nOffgrid homesteader Dan Mawhinney is in a race to airlift his stranded snow machine out of the frozen tundra.

Off gridder Dan Mawhinney decides to sell his cabin, but first he must find a buyer. On the railroad, delays threaten to put the train behind schedule.\r\n\r\n6)  Ice Hell \r\nSteve, Cassie, and their baby, face down a threat to their food supply, Dan Mulwhinney must make a grueling 5 hour hike in the wilderness.
