Failure to heed this warning could inadvertently throw unauthorized users into a persistent vegetative state, or at the very least, require administration of a defibrillator to the chest and/or groin area. Nobody wants that.\n\nFor months, shy drummer Jinx Hardwick has been silently crushing on her tall, dark, and scary bandmate, Toombs Badcock. Drawn to his frightening ink and scars, she yearns to uncover the shadowy secrets lurking behind his silver eyes, but Jinx is too intimidated to even look at him, let alone talk to him. When she stumbles upon Toombs and their manipulative lead guitarist Rax in a compromising position, Jinx realizes her chances of winning ToombsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a long shotÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re nonexistent. To make matters worse, JinxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family needs her at home. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to back away from it allÃ¢â‚¬â€Toombs, the band, her dreams of fame and fortuneÃ¢â‚¬â€when Rax makes her an offer she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse: a no-holds-barred night alone with Toombs. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one small catch. She has to go through Rax to get it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a744f5242912720d13b100716cdc4096be9e6ca","amp;dn":"Beats+-+Kendall+Grey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a744f5242912720d13b100716cdc4096be9e6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,116,79,82,66,145,39,32,209,59,16,7,22,205,196,9,107,233,230,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
