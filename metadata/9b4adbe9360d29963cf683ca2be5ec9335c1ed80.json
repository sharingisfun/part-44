The cantankerously quiet man from Blarney isn't widely regarded for his charisma - notoriously shy, both in interview mode and when indulging in banter (or lack thereof) between songs when performing live. But as his platinum-selling second album White Lies proved, Flannery lets his music do the talking - and it's well able to sell itself. Three and a half years on from the release of White Lies comes Red to Blue - the part-time stonemason turned troubadour once again carving and chiselling a collection of songs which are rooted in misery but triumph through the adversity.\n\nOpening track 'Gone Forever' sets the tone as the first of four amped-up tracks on this instalment of the Flannery discography - his voice in top form, bluesy rock at its finest, with a killer harmonica solo to boot. Similarly, his soaring chorus vocals against a background of brass on 'No Way To Live' impress greatly. Title-track 'Red to Blue' is probably the closest we'll ever get to an all-out anthem from Flannery - and surprisingly, it's a style which works well for him. But the real allure of Mick Flannery continually lies in the angst-laden ballads - and they're in no short supply on Red to Blue.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/02/mick-flannery/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/05/02/mick-flannery/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4adbe9360d29963cf683ca2be5ec9335c1ed80","amp;dn":"Mick+Flannery...Red+to+Blue%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b4adbe9360d29963cf683ca2be5ec9335c1ed80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,74,219,233,54,13,41,150,60,246,131,202,43,229,236,147,53,193,237,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
