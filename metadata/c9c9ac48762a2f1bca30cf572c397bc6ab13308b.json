The libretto was written by Lorenzo Da Ponte.\n\nCosÃƒÂ¬ fan tutte is one of the three Mozart operas for which Da Ponte wrote the libretto. The other two Da Ponte-Mozart collaborations were Le nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni.\n\nAlthough it is commonly held that CosÃƒÂ¬ fan tutte was written and composed at the suggestion of the Emperor Joseph II, recent research does not support this idea.There is evidence that Mozart's contemporary Antonio Salieri tried to set the libretto but left it unfinished. In 1994, John Rice uncovered two terzetti by Salieri in the Austrian National Library.\n\nThe title, CosÃƒÂ¬ fan tutte, literally means &quot;Thus do all [women]&quot; but it is often rendered as &quot;Women are like that&quot;. The words are sung by the three men in act 2, scene 13, just before the finale. Da Ponte had used the line &quot;CosÃƒÂ¬ fan tutte le belle&quot; earlier in Le nozze di Figaro (in act 1, scene 7).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c9ac48762a2f1bca30cf572c397bc6ab13308b","amp;dn":"Cosi+fan+tutte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c9ac48762a2f1bca30cf572c397bc6ab13308b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,201,172,72,118,42,47,27,202,48,207,87,44,57,123,198,171,19,48,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
