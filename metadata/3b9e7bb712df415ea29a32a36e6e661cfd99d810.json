I can not\ndecide which sets are better, the Geilguds or the Hobbs.  Both\nthough are the best Sherlock I have heard and better than any\nSherlock movies I have seen.  The only thing better is reading\nthe original stories.  Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b9e7bb712df415ea29a32a36e6e661cfd99d810","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+Old+Time+Radio+OTR+%28Hobbs%2C+Shelley+1959-1969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b9e7bb712df415ea29a32a36e6e661cfd99d810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,158,123,183,18,223,65,94,162,154,50,163,110,110,102,28,253,153,216,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
