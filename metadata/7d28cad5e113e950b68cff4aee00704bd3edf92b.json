So when local legend Slim Hazard offers them the chance to sell cupcakes at the annual Juniper Pass rodeo, they're determined to rope in a pretty payday!\n\nBut not everyone at the Juniper Pass is as sweet for Fairy Tale Cupcakes as Slim--including star bull-rider Ty Stokes. Mel and Angie try to steer clear of the cowboy's short fuse, but when his dead body is found face down in the hay, it's a whole different rodeo.\n\nWith a vengeful murderer on the loose, the ladies are quickly realizing that while they came to save their business, they may have to save themselves--and that's no bull.\n\nINCLUDES SCRUMPTIOUS RECIPES[/code][/size][/color]\n\n[color=red][size=100]Want To Increase your Knowledge on Ebook File Formats\n\nCheck It Out\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[img]http://www.shotpix.com/images/61235180290302869457.png[/img][/size][/color]\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img819/6804/0f72845cdfe90fb87159e29.gif[/img]\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img526/6562/9bdwrd.gif[/img]\n[img]http://imageshack.us/a/img521/161/2ywtrmc.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d28cad5e113e950b68cff4aee00704bd3edf92b","amp;dn":"Red+Velvet+Revenge%5BCupcake+Bakery+Mystery%5D+by+Jenn+McKinlay%5BSir.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d28cad5e113e950b68cff4aee00704bd3edf92b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,40,202,213,225,19,233,80,182,140,255,74,238,0,112,75,211,237,249,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
