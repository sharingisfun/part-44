Jesus Can't Save Me \n\n\nThis Primal Scream self titled album, following 2 years after the debut Sonic Flower Groove, is nothing less than straight-forward rock &amp; roll, with a pronounced MC5/Detroit influence: rock-ballad-rock-ballad throughout the album. And it works perfectly. It didn't escape my attention that the producer is listed as Sister Anne - a blatant tribute to the Five - and that the song Gimme Gimme Teenage Head is essentially a rewrite of Kick Out the Jams. I don't think there is anything else in the Primal Scream discography that sounds like this, but it is definitely worth seeking out on it's own merits. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 58\nArtist: Primal Scream\nAlbum: Primal Scream\nYear: 1989\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febefec82980c09f3d59fbcff6ff9f5975c14c2c","amp;dn":"Primal+Scream+-+Primal+Scream+%5BFLAC-1989%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febefec82980c09f3d59fbcff6ff9f5975c14c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,190,254,200,41,128,192,159,61,89,251,207,246,255,159,89,117,193,76,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
