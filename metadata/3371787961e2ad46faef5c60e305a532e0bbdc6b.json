A dead body in a very ugly sportscoat and matching socks. The dead man is a stranger to Perry, but that's not much of a comfort; how did a strange dead man get in a locked flat at the isolated Alton Estate in the wilds of the &quot;Northeast Kingdom&quot; of Vermont? Perry flees downstairs to get help and runs into &quot;tall, dark and hostile&quot; former navy SEAL Nick Reno.\n\nReno doesn't have a lot of time for drama queens, but, convinced that Perry's jitters are based on something more than caffeine overdose, he heads upstairs to investigate. By then the body has disappeared. If there's one thing Nick has learned the hard way, it's to mind his own business. But Perry Foster doesn't believe in ghosts and isn't willing to let sleeping dead men lie. And Nick just can't convince himself to walk when it's becoming increasingly obvious someone wants the sexy young artist out of the way Ã¢â‚¬â€ permanently.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3371787961e2ad46faef5c60e305a532e0bbdc6b","amp;dn":"The+Ghost+Wore+Yellow+Socks+-+Josh+Lanyon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3371787961e2ad46faef5c60e305a532e0bbdc6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,113,120,121,97,226,173,70,250,239,92,96,227,5,165,50,224,187,220,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
