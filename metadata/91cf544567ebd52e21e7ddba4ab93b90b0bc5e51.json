Set in the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of Ilium by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles. Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege.\n\nWritten in English by Alexander Pope, said to be one of the greatest translations in literary history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cf544567ebd52e21e7ddba4ab93b90b0bc5e51","amp;dn":"The+Iliad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cf544567ebd52e21e7ddba4ab93b90b0bc5e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,207,84,69,103,235,213,46,33,231,221,186,74,185,59,144,176,188,94,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
