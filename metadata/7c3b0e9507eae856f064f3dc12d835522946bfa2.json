They arrive incognito and find, not just the coal mine affairs, but a murder of a moneylender in which the son of the mine owner and his four friends are implicated. They find to their delight, that the local police inspector is their old friend, Inspector Borat. Together, they unravel the two mysteries, piece by piece, but not before Byomkesh is assaulted and injured and Ajit decides to take over!\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nAnjan Dutt had given us three Saradindu Bandyopadhyay films with Abir Chatterjee in the lead as Byomkesh, but since Abir Chatterjee was contracted to act in a number of films as Feluda, he switched to Jishu Sengupta. Jishu does very well. His Byomkesh is a little more restless - a sleuth who can make mistakes and correct them. Dutt peppers the film with humour, just as Saradindu did, and it shows for this is a very enjoyable film.\r\n\r\nTo add to the enjoyment we have some very nice cinematography by Indraneel Mukhopadhyay and some rather recognisable music by Neel dutt. But editing by Arghyakamal is good and he des not let the film lag. Overall a film that you will enjoy..\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThe quality of this rip will also add to your enjoyment. We have slightly adjusted the yellow tint and brought out detail a bit. Unfortunately, it is a DVd by RP Technovision, which means that subtitles are hardcoded. Apart from this the DVd is of good quality as you can see from the sample..\r\n\r\nAfter a long time a x264 rip from me. Primarily because rijVnet is away.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMDB Link:\r\nNot available\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine DDR release @ ExtraTorrent.com\r\n   \nhttps://extratorrent.cc/   \nhttps://extratorrent.com/   \nhttp://extratorrent.ws/   \nhttps://etproxy.com/   \nhttps://extratorrentlive.com/   \nhttps://extratorrentonline.com/   \nhttps://etmirror.com/   \nhttps://extratorrent.works/   \nhttps://extratorrent.date/   \nhttps://etproxy.top/\r\n\r\nShare your Images with:\r\n   \nhttp://extraimago.com/\r\n\r\nHelp us by donating with Bitcoin: 1XeH1kKXWYbzZcFHokGiZ4d3MWW5WyXzU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3b0e9507eae856f064f3dc12d835522946bfa2","amp;dn":"Byomkesh.Bakshi-+Kahen.Kobi.Kalidas+-+DVD.Rip+-+x264.AC3+-+DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3b0e9507eae856f064f3dc12d835522946bfa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,59,14,149,7,234,232,86,240,100,243,220,18,216,53,82,41,70,191,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
