Often, study techniques that served students well in high school don't measure up in their new environment. The answer: finding out how to study and learn strategically. Geared to instructors, College Study Skills provides both the guidance and the hands-on exercises needed to help students improve their ability to learn in the university setting. Chapters on adjusting to college, setting goals, improving memory and concentration, and managing time complement those dealing with more concrete skills such as reading, note-taking, highlighting, preparing for exams, and taking essay tests. In addition to clearly explaining different learning strategies, each chapter also includes useful examples as well as practice activities and self-evaluation techniques. --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.\nReview\n&quot; ...a very current and comprehensive text.
