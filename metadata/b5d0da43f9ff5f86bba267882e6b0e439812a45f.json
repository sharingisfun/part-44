She showed interest in music early on, pursued music since childhood, and graduated from Wellesley High School in 2004. She studied performing arts technology at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and graduated in 2008.[2][3]\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011 she was the lead vocalist of the Ann Arbor, Michigan, band Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ella RiotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, formerly called &quot;My Dear Disco&quot;.[3][4] In college she was classmates with band founder Tyler Duncan, and she had previously recorded a track with band guitarist Robert Ã¢â‚¬Å“DJ Body-RockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lester. Prior to her entry, the band was an instrumental group. Her entry became a turning point in the band's direction.[3] The name change from &quot;My Dear Disco&quot; to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ella RiotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ came partly because she was a big fan of Ella Fitzgerald.[5]\n\nSince 2011 she has worked independently. She has released many albums and single records - in conjunction with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ella RiotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, independently, as well as in collaboration with other artists. Many releases are under artistic trade name Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Reverb JunkieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nPlaylist\n\n01 - Michelle Chamuel - I Kissed A Girl + Intro\n02 - Michelle Chamuel - Raise Your Glass\n03 - Michelle Chamuel - True Colors\n04 - Michelle Chamuel - Call Your Girlfriend\n05 - Michelle Chamuel - Just Give Me A Reason\n06 - Michelle Chamuel - Grenade\n07 - Michelle Chamuel - Somewhere Only We Know\n08 - Michelle Chamuel - I Knew You Were Trouble\n09 - Michelle Chamuel - Clarity\n10 - Michelle Chamuel - Time After Time\n11 - Michelle Chamuel - Why\n12 - Michelle Chamuel &amp; Usher - One\n13 - Coaching Techniques\n14 - Michelle Chamuel &amp; One Republic - Counting Stars\n15 - Michelle Chamuel, Vedo, Josiah Hawley &amp; Cathia - We Can Work It Out\n\n*** Michelle's Battle Round Performance was not aired *** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d0da43f9ff5f86bba267882e6b0e439812a45f","amp;dn":"Michelle+Chamuel+-+The+Voice+Season+4+-+Live+Video+Performances+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d0da43f9ff5f86bba267882e6b0e439812a45f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,208,218,67,249,255,95,134,187,162,103,136,46,107,14,67,152,18,164,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
