Deep, buried emotion, like the Kraken, threatens to burst the dark, dissembling surface.\nThis is a BBC feature with readings of The Kraken, Sea-Fairies, Enoch Arden, (Sam Dale) The Voyage of Maeldune and Crossing the Bar, all accompanied by an atmospheric soundscape. The reading of Enoch Arden is first-rate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3202a33b25384715ac7f363ddc4224c8b6bb9e09","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Tennyson+-+5+-+Sea+Poems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3202a33b25384715ac7f363ddc4224c8b6bb9e09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,2,163,59,37,56,71,21,172,127,54,61,220,66,36,200,182,187,158,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
