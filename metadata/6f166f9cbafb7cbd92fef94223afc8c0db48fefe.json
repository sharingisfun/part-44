They maybe two of the biggest mega movie stars in the world, but they're also great parents, philanthropists and just all-around good people.\nWhen they disappear without a word from their ranch, facts are hard to find. They live behind such a high wall of security and image control that even world-renowned Private Investigator Jack Morgan can't get to the truth. But as Jack keeps probing, secrets sprout thick and fast--and the world's golden couple may emerge as hiding behind a world of desperation and deception that the wildest reality show couldn't begin to unveil. Murder is only the opening scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f166f9cbafb7cbd92fef94223afc8c0db48fefe","amp;dn":"James+Patterson+-+Private+06+-+Private+L.A.+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f166f9cbafb7cbd92fef94223afc8c0db48fefe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,22,111,156,186,251,124,189,146,254,249,66,35,175,200,192,219,72,254,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
