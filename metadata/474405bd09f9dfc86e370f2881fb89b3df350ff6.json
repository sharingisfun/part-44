FOR WOMEN: Eavesdrop on the secret codes of masculinity. Discover what makes men tick. Penetrate the brain-fog of masculine thinking. Peel the cerebral onion of guy-hood. Find out how to get your way with your man. FOR GUYS: Here&amp;#039;s a fishing trip down the river of your natural self. A vacation from &quot;relationships.&quot; A holiday from all things feminine. A trout stream for your brain, naturally cleansed of &quot;shopping,&quot; feminism and other female-borne viruses. A chance to drain the blackened oil from your cerebral engine, and fill it with five clean quarts of good feelings about yourself. Kick off your boots and wiggle your frozen toes on the fireplace of your masculine soul. You&amp;#039;ll never be the same again. \n\nThis is an anti-corporate, anti-feminist book which attempts to explain the gap between the sexes as the cause of modern ills. Very provocative stuff. The author, Rich Zubaty, is well educated through the University of Chicago and was once married to a hot lawyer who fucked him over royally with lies until he was dirt poor and unable to see his kids. Since then he has retreated to a simple life in the pacific islands away from the problems of the new world. He hopes for a reemergence of masculine pride. A must read book for all men, and women too! Definitely unique.\n\nKey question: Why does our society call itself a patriarchy, when it feels like a matriarchy?\n\nThesis: All feminists are corporate whores.\n\n*************\n\nprint a copy. keep it in the bathroom for reading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:474405bd09f9dfc86e370f2881fb89b3df350ff6","amp;dn":"%5Be-Book%5D+What+Men+Know+that+Women+Dont+-+Rich+Zubaty+%5Bpdf%2C+500pg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"474405bd09f9dfc86e370f2881fb89b3df350ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,68,5,189,9,249,223,200,110,55,15,40,129,251,137,179,223,53,15,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
