Her work influenced many other artists of Russian rock underground.\n\nThe world of Yana's songs is a gray sketch, string stops the desolation and ruin, the time is out. It consists of tram rails, sleepers, traffic lights, boots, cells... Militaristic urbanized landscape, the world is populated by inanimate, and even living in it is comparable with the dead. It would be desirable grass, warm wind, sun, but we have nothing and never will be - only memories of what should have been. Songs of Yana is lament about people who in life are doomed to death...\n\nThis anthology on 4 CD was prepared by Yegor Letov, a close friend and associate of Yanka, and was issued in 2009.\n\nlanguage: Russian\n\nfont: Cyrillic, Latin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1b36289fec4b2c195c8d3b013780d9a61bf810","amp;dn":"Yana+Dyagileva+%2F+%D0%AF%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%94%D1%8F%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1b36289fec4b2c195c8d3b013780d9a61bf810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,27,54,40,159,236,75,44,25,92,141,59,1,55,128,217,166,27,248,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
