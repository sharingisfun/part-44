It also highlights the work of the urban archaeologist, and the problems inherent in preserving our past, when the interests of archaeology and property development clash.\n\nEnjoy Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89fe36778f8000ff12e69aee5ee6b83e85028266","amp;dn":"Archaeology+in+British+Towns+++%281996+-+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89fe36778f8000ff12e69aee5ee6b83e85028266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,254,54,119,143,128,0,255,18,230,154,238,94,230,184,62,133,2,130,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
