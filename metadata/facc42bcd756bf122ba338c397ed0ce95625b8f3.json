No need to try to remember where that great research site is because you bookmarked it at home - all the information you need is saved in the Firefox Portable file, ready to use no matter where you are.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no great mystery to using Firefox Portable. You install it wherever - maybe on a flash drive or USB key for portability - open the file and use it like you would your normal Firefox. You can browse, bookmark and do anything you would normally, but the great advantage is that when you want to go, just take the Firefox Portable file with you and you'll have all your saved information, but no trace of your presence on the computer you've been using.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:facc42bcd756bf122ba338c397ed0ce95625b8f3","amp;dn":"Mozilla+Firefox+Portable+Latest+version+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"facc42bcd756bf122ba338c397ed0ce95625b8f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,204,66,188,215,86,191,18,43,163,56,195,151,237,12,233,86,37,184,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
