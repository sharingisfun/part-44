An earthquake rampaged across the land and all that was left are gaping cliffs over valleys, rivers and even in the cities. Build the bridges anew and then commence the stress-test with two different difficulty levels by letting cars drive over your bridge or even heavy trucks. If the bridge is still standing you can proudly call youself a true engineer and may go further helping the people of Camatuga.\n\nAfter a while you will realize your budget is not infinite and also the gapes are getting bigger and bigger! Luckily you have several construction materials at your disposal such as wood, concrete or steel cable. Each of these materials has different attributes and will offer you countless possible solutions. But be warned, as you progress through the game it will get more and more difficult! Less budget, bigger gaps to master and even material limitations won't make this a no-brainer.\n\nA game that certainly will make you think again, so dust off this grey matter and be creative, build bridges, keep an eye on your budget and unite Camatuga again!\n\nFeatures:\n30 stages with several possible solutions\nBuild bridges over valleys, canals and rivers\nConstruction material like wood, steel, cable and concrete pillars\nStress test for the bridge with cars or trucks (two difficulties)\nFacebook connection to show off your best bridges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922c4e8c17e68e1dd4abe688be35a8ebe9b42160","amp;dn":"Bridge+Constructor+%5BDRM+Free%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922c4e8c17e68e1dd4abe688be35a8ebe9b42160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,44,78,140,23,230,142,29,212,171,230,136,190,53,168,235,233,180,33,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
