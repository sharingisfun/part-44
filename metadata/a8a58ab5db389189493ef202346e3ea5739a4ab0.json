The band has released seven studio albums, three additional albums in SpanishÃ¢â‚¬â€and toured extensively worldwide. There are also numerous compilations, live records and bootlegs available.\n\nContents\n\n    \n\nThe band managed to strike a record deal with Enigma Records in 1985, after Hart's high school friend, Eric Blair, (who worked for the Christian metal band Stryper) pitched the Rock in Victory EP to Enigma Records President, Wesley Hein. When they found out there was a Spanish band also going by the name Fusion, they changed the band name to Gardian - intentionally misspelled to have 7 letters. In early 1986, Caro left the band and was replaced by guitarist Tony Palacios. With Palacios, there surfaced a bootleg EP, Voyager in 1987Ã¢â‚¬â€which were really just pre-production demos recorded in the backroom of an Orange successful. The current release is scheduled for early 2014.\nPost-Guardian\nFounding member/bassist David Bach 2013.\n\nAfter the band went on semi-hiatus in the late 90s, bassist David Bach served as VP of A&amp;R for five years with EMI's ForeFront Records. He also served in the same capacity for Sony/BMG-owned Reunion Records before reuniting with veteran producers John and Dino Elefante to serve as label chief in a production/record company called 3.1 Productions, which included the Selectric Records imprint that Bach solely oversaw.\n\n\nIn 2011, Guardian founder Paul Cawley and former drummer Rikk Hart released a three-song EP called &quot;Empire&quot;, under the band name Guardian 1.\nBand members\nCurrent members\n\n    David Bach - bass (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Tony Palacios - guitar (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Jamie Rowe - vocals (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Karl Ney - drums (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Jamey Perrenot - guitar (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nFormer members\n\n    Paul Cawley - vocals/guitar (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990)\n    Gene Thurston - guitar (1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983)\n    David Caro - guitar (1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1986)\n    James Isham - guitar (1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1984)\n    Steve Martinez - drums (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983)County music store.ame \tArtist \tTime \tPrice \t \n1\n\tBoom She Said \tGuardian \t3:37 \t$0.69 \t\n\tThe Real Me \tGuardian \t3:45 \t$0.69 \t\n3\n\tLittle Things \tGuardian \t4:37 \t$0.69 \t\n4\n\tWonderful \tGuardian \t4:34 \t$0.69 \t\n5\n\tCalifornia Rain \tGuardian \t3:50 \t$0.69 \t\n6\n\tShow Us What You Got (Interlude) \tGuardian \t1:22 \t$0.69 \t\n\tKing of Fools \tGuardian \t4:03 \t$0.69 \t\n8\n\tThe Calling (Interlude) \tGuardian \t1:01 \t$0.69 \t\n\tParanoia Kills \tGuardian \t2:55 \t$0.69 \t\n10\n\tPrice We Pay \tGuardian \t3:50 \t$0.69 \t\n11\n\tFree \tGuardian \t3:23 \t$0.69 \t\n12\n\tRequiem Calavera (Interlude) \tGuardian \t0:40 \t$0.69 \t\n13\n\tAlmost Home \tGuardian \t4:30 \t$0.69 \t\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a58ab5db389189493ef202346e3ea5739a4ab0","amp;dn":"Guardian+-+Almost+Home++mp3++320k++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a58ab5db389189493ef202346e3ea5739a4ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,165,138,181,219,56,145,137,73,62,242,2,52,110,62,165,115,154,74,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
