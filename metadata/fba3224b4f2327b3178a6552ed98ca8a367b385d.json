It's well-paced with fine acting: \n young and beautiful Bette Davis is enjoyable to watch, but her sophistication seems a bit out of place while working for a hood;\n George Brent is as suave as ever; and Ricardo Cortez makes a good heavy, with lighting effects making him look more sinister. \nI also liked the acting of many of the supporting characters such as Robert Strange (who is a standout), J. Carroll Naish and \nJoseph Sawyer, as three of Cortez's murdering henchmen. Anyone who likes the genre should like this film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fba3224b4f2327b3178a6552ed98ca8a367b385d","amp;dn":"Special+Agent+%28Bette+Davis%2C+George+Brent%29+%5B1935%5D+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fba3224b4f2327b3178a6552ed98ca8a367b385d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,163,34,75,79,35,39,179,23,138,101,82,237,152,202,138,54,123,56,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
