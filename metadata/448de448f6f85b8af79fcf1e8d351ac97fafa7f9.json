Sadly, since cbs hdtv \ndelivery overnormalizes the unfortunately \nrare surround effect... pretty much nothing.\nOf course you would have to 1. Know anything\nat all about audio encoding, and 2. Know \nanything at all about US television delivery\nsystems. This of course applies to CW, whos\ndelivery is also handled by... CBS. Anyone\nwho owns a real receiver that shows speaker \nchannel output can easily confirm this by\nby comparing individual channel info.So, why\nnot stop trying to justify preing stuff that\nis encoded from sources that are inferior to\nour actual final encodes? Or do you jsut \nneed more credits for the cappers you\nrecruited from IMMERSE and SiTV? ( more on \nthat in a future nfo :) )\n\nWhat exactly have you posers contributed to\nthe 720p x264 section in the last 3 years?\nBesides the invntion of x264 first pass \nsegmenting (that you denied for 18 months\nuntil your non secure, recruited by email, \n_____ leaked your tool and made denying it\nany longer even more ludicorus)nothing at \nall. So, once again, why are you posers \nstill here preing from sources that are \ninferior to other groups final encodes?\n\nComing up soon in an nfo near you--\nA) Trip down memory lane revisiting the\ncontinuums contributions to butchering\nother sections.\nB) An explantion of the morons faked rar\nheaders (except for the .rar which is \npatched at the end)\nC) A discussion on why the tv scene is\nthe only section that sadly allows poorly\ncoded one click tools\nD) A look into having said tools omit \ncertain data (eg no_variable_info) and if\nits truly a valid method of trying to\ncheat out the no modified header info rule\nAs well as which groups are using said \ntool and why.\nE) Rats, rats, and more rats. No one is \nsafe anymore.\n\nEnjoy ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448de448f6f85b8af79fcf1e8d351ac97fafa7f9","amp;dn":"CSI.New.York.S07E10.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448de448f6f85b8af79fcf1e8d351ac97fafa7f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,141,228,72,246,248,91,138,247,159,207,30,141,53,26,201,127,175,167,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
