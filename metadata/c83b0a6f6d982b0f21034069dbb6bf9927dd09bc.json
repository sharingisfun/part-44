A Far Better Thing (alternate version)\n\nSmokey Mims and his sister Vicki made the huge leap from the Greenwich Village folk clubs and coffee houses to sign with Columbia Records where they released a pair of now highly-prized singles in 1967. Produced by David Rubinson, the trippy, harmony-laced Smokey and his Sister debut album, unfathomably, has remained on the shelf until now. Precious and beautiful, this album has finally arrived to turn whispered rumor into hauntingly seductive reality. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83b0a6f6d982b0f21034069dbb6bf9927dd09bc","amp;dn":"Smokey+And+His+Sister...Smokey+And+His+Sister%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83b0a6f6d982b0f21034069dbb6bf9927dd09bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,59,10,111,109,152,43,15,33,3,64,105,219,182,191,153,39,221,9,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
