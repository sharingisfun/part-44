The album reached a high of #17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 200 album charts on the strength of the lead single &quot;The Warrior&quot;.\n\nScandal is a rock band from the 1980s fronted by Patty Smyth. The band scored a hit in the United States with the song &quot;The Warrior&quot;, which peaked at #7 in 1984. Their other major hits were &quot;Goodbye to You&quot; (1982 - #65 US), &quot;Love's Got A Line On You&quot; (1983 - #59 US), &quot;Hands Tied&quot; (1984 - #41 US), and &quot;Beat of A Heart&quot; (1985 - #41 US).\n\nScandal was formed in New York City in 1981 by guitarist Zack Smith, who also wrote most of the band's hits. The other initial members included: bassist Ivan Elias (1950Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995), guitarist Keith Mack, guitarist Jon Bon Jovi (briefly), keyboardist Benjy King, drummer Frankie LaRocka (later replaced by Thommy Price), and vocalist Patty Smyth.\n\nThe band had much success early on but due to struggles within the group and their record company, it slowly dissolvedÃ¢â‚¬â€losing member after member. By the time &quot;The Warrior&quot; tour hit the road in 1984, all that remained of the original lineup were Smyth and Mack. Scandal broke up shortly after the tour ended.\n(video has a yellow &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warrior_(Scandal_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warrior_(Scandal_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/IANPGAadL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/IANPGAadL&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 5000kbps\n   Audio1: MPEG Layer 2 Audio 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:08\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
