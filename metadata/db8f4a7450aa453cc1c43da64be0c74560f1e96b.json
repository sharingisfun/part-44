And  recommend surround sound.\n\nDownloaded these, some screenshots are enclosed:\n\nGravity.2013.1080p.BluRay.REMUX.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-PublicHD\nGravity.2013.1080p.BluRay.DTS-HD.MA.5.1.x264-PublicHD\nGravity.2013.1080p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous\nGravity (2013) [1080p] YIFY\nGravity.2013.1080p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS\nGravity.2013.720p.BRRip.x264.AAC-ViSiON\nGravity 2013 1080p BRRIP  x264 AAC KiNGDOM\nGravity.2013.1080p.WEB-DL.x264-LTT\n\nAudio (figures denote typ/max bitrates, data is usually from MediaInfo tool): SPARKS 6CH DTS 1509kbps, VISION 6CH AAC 445/664kbps, KINGDOM 6CH AAC 320/334kbps, Anoxmous 6CH 375kbps &amp; 2CH 124kbps AAC, YIFY 2CH AAC 93/105kbps.\n\nConclusions among 1-7GB rips: KINGDOM/YIFY/VISION/SPARKS have the same video quality level (negligible differences, and the bigger files are not better), Anoxmous and LTT have noteably lower richness in details. I recommend going for VISION, which also has 6ch audio of excellent quality (to have use for higher quality audio than that you need a $100000 speaker setup and perfect hearing, trust me).\n\nSo one thing to learn from this is: If you squeeze 1080p into a very small file then the quality migh end up being lower than rips encoded as 720p. SPARKS surprises me a bit, would have expected better quality for a 6,6GB rip. Anoxmous was second from the bottom, but he usually does very good rips.\n\n10-15GB rips: If you don't have a giant screen then don't bother with these. But there is a small but noteable difference in sharpness when going from VISION to the 10GB rip. And the 15GB rip handles noise better (noise in the video is hard for the encoders to capture at low bitrates) which gives it a small but noticeable improvement in detail. See screenshots.\n\nCaptures used while playing video in Media Player Classic Home Cinema, and saved lossless using IrfanView. Note that for most of them I have zoomed to &quot;fit height to screen&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8f4a7450aa453cc1c43da64be0c74560f1e96b","amp;dn":"Gravity+2013+SCREENSHOTS+%28YIFY%2C+SPARKS%2C+ANOXMOUS%2C+LTT%2C+PUBLICHD%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8f4a7450aa453cc1c43da64be0c74560f1e96b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,143,74,116,80,170,69,60,193,196,61,166,75,224,199,69,96,241,233,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
