Oliver, a good samaritan shoots at the robbers and stops the violence from getting worse and then turns himself into Pia on the Evening News rather than Frank and the NYPD. He has a record from a youthful mistake and is in possession of an illegal handgun. The questions of media and vigilantism resonates with the Reagans. Danny, Ava and a dozen copÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â­s track down Handsome in a Bronx subway station and arrest him. Pia is disappointed she did not get a chance to exploit Handsome's latest video made prior to this arrest, which concerns Frank. Erin helps find justice for Oliver and he will not go to jail. The vigilantism issue is on Jamie's mind and he begins to explore the nature of the Blue Templar and Danny's connection to them.
