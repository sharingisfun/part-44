The first single, &quot;&quot;Land of the Blind,&quot;&quot; is a swirling\npropulsive track that hearkens back to their signature sound yet\ninfuses it with state of the art production values. Longtime\nInSoc hero Gerald V. Casale adds his vocals in a duet with Kurt\non their cover of &quot;&quot;Beautiful World&quot;&quot; which adds a modern splash\nto the Devo classic. The group stormed the club charts in the mid\n80s with their Freestyle classic &quot;&quot;Running&quot;&quot;. Inspired by the\nworldwide response to the single, the group seized the\nopportunity and moved to New York to record their major label\ndebut, Information Society, for Tommy Boy/Reprise. Producer Fred\nMaher was brought in, fresh from his work on Kraftwerk's Electric\nCaf album, and helped Robb &amp; co. craft a tight pop sound\nInitial buzz for the first single &quot;&quot;What's On Your Mind Pure\nEnergy)&quot;&quot; was intense, and proved to be accurate; by the time the\ngroup got to its first in-store appearance, two days after the\nrecord's release, the album was sold out. 2014 is proving to be\nquite a year for the band. With history's tendency to repeat\nitself, it appears INSOC are poised for another takeover. _Hello\nWorld, indeed\n\n\n=================================================================================\n\nPlease Keep it For Continue Seeding and Help Others To Get Download\n\n================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c16dfbe0e32e0f0c6b1599ec454d6bd1cd0503","amp;dn":"Information_Society-_Hello_World-CD-FLAC-2014-FORSAKEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c16dfbe0e32e0f0c6b1599ec454d6bd1cd0503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,193,109,251,224,227,46,15,12,107,21,153,236,69,77,107,209,205,5,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
