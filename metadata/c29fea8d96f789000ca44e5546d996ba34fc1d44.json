George Schmid\nTimber Press | 2002 | ISBN: 0881925497 | English | 374 pages | PDF | 4 MB\n\nFinding an array of unique and diverse plants for shade might seem like a daunting task, with limited options available to the gardener. Shade perennial expert W. George Schmid dispels this perception in his new encyclopedia. This companionable reference provides information on more than 7000 species and cultivars in 184 genera, from Acanthus to Woodwardia Ã¢â‚¬â€ some new to horticulture, others unjustly overlooked, but all beautifully suited to the shade garden.\n\nSchmid has behind him a half century of practical gardening experience, horticultural education, and extensive travel observing shade perennials in their native habitats; readers are therefore treated to both useful growing tips and his personal associations with the plants. The expert text is rounded out with 500 stunning color photographs, many taken by the author himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29fea8d96f789000ca44e5546d996ba34fc1d44","amp;dn":"An+Encyclopedia+of+Shade+Perennials+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29fea8d96f789000ca44e5546d996ba34fc1d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,159,234,141,150,247,137,0,12,164,78,85,70,217,150,186,52,252,29,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
