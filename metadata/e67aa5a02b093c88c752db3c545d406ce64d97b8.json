The English Gothic style developed somewhat later than in France, but rapidly developed its own architectural and ornamental codes. The author, John Shannon Hendrix, classifies English Gothic architecture in four principal stages: the early English Gothic, the decorated, the curvilinear, and the perpendicular Gothic. Several photographs of these architectural testimonies allow us to understand the whole originality of Britain during the Gothic era: in Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, and Salisbury. The English Gothic architecture is a poetic one, speaking both to the senses and spirit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67aa5a02b093c88c752db3c545d406ce64d97b8","amp;dn":"The+splendour+of+English+Gothic+Architecture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67aa5a02b093c88c752db3c545d406ce64d97b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,122,165,160,43,9,60,136,199,82,219,60,84,93,64,108,230,77,151,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
