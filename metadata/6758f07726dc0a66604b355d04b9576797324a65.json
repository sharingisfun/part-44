This advanced workshop assumes familiarity with The EFT Course. Many approaches, shortcuts and sophisticated uses of EFT are explored. Recommended for ALL EFT students, not just therapists.\n\nBenefits:\n\n* Blends together two live advanced EFT workshops so that the best of each workshop is included.\n* Original cost of each workshop was $600 plus travel, hotel, etc. You get it all for a fraction that and can explore it at home at your leisure.\n* Gary Craig spent over $100,000 to develop what is being taught here.\n* Demonstrates how to do telephone work, diagnosis and much more.\n* Instant replay any video segment for thorough learning.\n\n\nContents: From Gary Craig\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s original description of this comprehensive DVD set.\n\n* Interspersed among all the presentations listed below, I develop, describe and demonstrate an intuitive/intention based diagnostic technique that I use instead of Dr. Callahan\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Voice Technology. As you may be aware, Dr. Roger Callahan charges $100,000 to teach his secretive Voice Technology and I was his very first student in this technique. I found it useful but have abandoned it in favor of what you will learn, in great detail, in these videos. The technique is not only taught in detail but it is also demonstrated in 8 live sessions. You will watch the process in operation and it will be on video so you can \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;instant replay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and study it as much as you want. In 2 of these live sessions, the client and I turn our chairs back to back as I demonstrate the use of the technique as though it were being done over the telephone.\n* Brian Foley discusses in great detail his comprehensive algorithm (similar to EFT but uses different points and methods--very enlightening)\n* Hypnotherapist Marilyn Gordon discusses and demonstrates in a live session her use of EFT while the client is in trance. You will see her bring up essential issues rather quickly and then apply EFT for rapid relief.\n* Alan Handelsman introduces his Resonance Tuning device which addresses energy blocks and often brings about relief from pain as well as substance and other sensitivities. In a live session he first demonstrates a unique (and gentle) form of muscle testing and then proceeds to use his Resonance Tuning device to eliminate a participant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s sensitivity to her cell phone. You will hear other seminar attendees favorably comment on their results with this unique device.\n* Sandi Radomski augments the presentations of Tapas Fleming and Alan Handelsman by discussing her positive experiences in using EFT for substance sensitivities.\n* Acupuncturist Michael Gandy provides fascinating new insights into the energy techniques. He introduces three new tapping points which, as a group, address all of the major meridians. These tapping points were used quite effectively throughout the seminar. Michael also is able to monitor what I am doing with a client and knows exactly when channels clear. He does this by placing electrodes on the client and himself and then muscle testing himself regarding the client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s various emotions, meridians, pains, etc. This process is uniquely Michael\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s and is demonstrated here on video for the first time ever. You will observe Michael doing this while I work with two different clients.\n* Stanford scientist, Dr. William A. Tiller, spends nearly two hours weaving his scientific findings on intention and intuition into our healing procedures. He has performed thousands of controlled experiments on the validity of intention and its very real effect on our lives (and your practice). As examples of this you will hear him describe numerous succesful experiments regarding intention and you will see actual photographs taken with the lens cap still on the camera. No fooling. This can only be done, of course, if something is at work besides normal physics. Our intention is far more pervasive and powerful than we think. It just needs to be cultivated. Both intention and intuition were centerpieces of our seminars and Dr. Tiller\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s captivating talk provides an impressive foundation for many of my later sessions.\n* As another example of the power of intention, Dr. Marla Brucker demonstrates the use of our intention as an aid to bending metal spoons and forks. You will watch her while she turns an ordinary fork into a deformed pretzel in seconds. Many of the seminar attendees were able to do similar metal bending on the first try.\n* In addition to all of the above, you will watch a compelling session where I have the entire group work on their physical discomforts while imagining the tapping. The results were similar to that of physical tapping. This opens doors for new ways of delivering the EFT process.\n* I also introduce the use of creative affirmations. These were well received and many participants noticed healing results at the moment they did the creative affirmations. Many, many examples are given. In fact, these intuitive affirmations occur throughout these videos. Just learning to do these is worth many times the price of these videos.\n* Further, I have a session with the audience addressing breathing constrictions. This, as it turns out, provides an interesting and creative way to address a client\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s emotional problem in a relatively painless manner. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s because emotional issues often go hand-in-hand with breathing constrictions.\n* There are numerous discussions involving our high caliber audiences. The insights and wisdom they provide are priceless. Our audience contained MD\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, PhD\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s and accomplished healers of all types. They came from as far away as Australia, Switzerland, Spain, South Africa, UK, Canada, etc. They were eager to learn and share their knowledge. Their comments on these videos will become a vital and integral part of your learning experience.\n* There is an in depth exploration of (1) one-on-one muscle testing, (2) surrogate muscle testing and (3) intuitive forms of delivering EFT. All of this is demonstrated frequently throughout these videos.\n\nThere is more, much more, in these videos. They are filled with innovative quality from beginning to end and there is plenty of love, laughter and enthusiasm sprinkled throughout. The concepts flow from one to another just as if a story was unfolding. I am thrilled to have been a part of them.\n\nLove to all, Gary\n\nP.S. I thought you might like to review the final paragraph that I wrote in the original Advanced Seminar Announcement. It adds perspective to what you will see on the videos.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;In summary, I will be teaching diagnosis that, in my opinion, is unique in this field and surpasses just about everything out there. I do not consider it the ultimate ending place for all diagnosis, however. I consider it a beginning and expect that most of you will accelerate beyond these techniques and exceed my skills with them. I am opening a door here. Those who walk through it will find themselves in a Palace of Possibilities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6758f07726dc0a66604b355d04b9576797324a65","amp;dn":"The.EFT.Steps.To.Becoming.The.Ultimate.Therapist.DVDRip.XviD-VVi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6758f07726dc0a66604b355d04b9576797324a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,88,240,119,38,220,10,102,96,75,53,93,4,185,87,103,151,50,74,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
