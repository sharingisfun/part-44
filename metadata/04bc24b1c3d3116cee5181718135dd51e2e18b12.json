Jones, Billy Joe Walker, and John Hiatt -- who he also covers -- Crowell doesn't quite realize his concept. Although the songs are usually quite good, the sound of the record is forced and hamfisted. At the very least, the album suggested that Crowell was at his best when he was at his most direct. And he became direct on his next album, Diamonds &amp; Dirt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bc24b1c3d3116cee5181718135dd51e2e18b12","amp;dn":"Rodney+Crowell+-+Street+Language+%5B1986%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bc24b1c3d3116cee5181718135dd51e2e18b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,188,36,177,195,211,17,108,238,81,129,113,129,53,221,81,226,225,139,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
