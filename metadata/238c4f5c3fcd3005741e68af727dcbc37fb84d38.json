On this set of advanced originals (which also has versions of 'Let's Face the Music' and 'Some Other Time'), Wilson is the \n\nlead voice in dense ensembles that include (on various cuts) cornetist Olu Dara, guitarist Jean-Paul Bourelly, trumpeter Graham \n\nHaynes, and altoist Steve Coleman, along with a very active rhythm section. 'Some Other Time' is a change of pace, a duet with \n\npianist Rod Williams, but otherwise this is advanced free funk dance music. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nCassandra Wilson (Vocals) \nRod Williams (Synthesizer and Piano) \nMark Johnson (Drums) - 1-7,9 \nGraham Haynes (Trumpet) - 2,3,5-7,9 \nKevin Bruce Harris (Bass Guitar) - 1,3,5,9 \nKenneth Davis (Double Bass) - 2,4,6 \nJean-Paul Bourelly (Guitar) - 1,3 \nSteve Coleman (Alto Saxophone) - 4,7 \nOlu Dara (Cornet) - 1 \n\nCassandra Wilson - Days Aweigh Tracks:\n01  Electromagnolia (Olu Dara) 4:45 \n02  Let's Face The Music (Irving Berlin) 2:31 \n03  Days Aweigh (Jean-Paul Bourelly) 3:27 \n04  Subatomic Blues (Cassandra Wilson) 4:35 \n05  Apricots On Their Wings (Henry Threadgill) 5:49 \n06  If You Know How (Cassandra Wilson) 5:08 \n07  You Belong To You (Cassandra Wilson) 4:55 \n08  Some Other Time (Leonard Bernstein/Betty Comden/Adolp Green) 5:12 \n09  Black And Yellow (Rod Williams) 5:38 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238c4f5c3fcd3005741e68af727dcbc37fb84d38","amp;dn":"Cassandra+Wilson+-+Days+Aweigh+%281987%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238c4f5c3fcd3005741e68af727dcbc37fb84d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,140,79,92,63,205,48,5,116,30,104,175,114,125,203,195,127,184,77,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
