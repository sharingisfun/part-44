HurleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deeply felt American patriotism and fixed ideas about confronting Nazism directly led to a mighty clash with Pope Pius XII. It was 1939, the earliest days of PiusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s papacy, and controversy within the Vatican over policy toward Nazi Germany was already heated. This groundbreaking book is both a biography of Joseph Hurley, the first American to achieve the rank of nuncio, or Vatican ambassador, and an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view of the alleged silence of the pope on the Holocaust and Nazism.\n\nDrawing on HurleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unpublished archives, the book documents critical debates in Pope PiusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vatican, secret U.S.-Vatican dealings, the influence of DetroitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flamboyant anti-Semitic priest Charles E. Coughlin, and the controversial case of CroatiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cardinal Stepinac. The book also sheds light on the powerful connections between religion and politics in the twentieth century.\n\nAbout the author:\nCharles R. Gallagher is currently engaged in theological studies at Heythrop College, University of London. He is the author of Cross and Crozier: A History of Catholicism in the Diocese of St. Augustine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e66844bb918543ee7f9fd8f6c0909f5bb084ea","amp;dn":"Vatican+Secret+Diplomacy+-+Charles+Gallagher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e66844bb918543ee7f9fd8f6c0909f5bb084ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,230,104,68,187,145,133,67,238,127,159,216,246,192,144,159,91,176,132,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
