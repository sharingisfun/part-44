Two&quot; 5:13\n\n  Perhaps best likened to a marching band on an acid trip, Neutral Milk Hotel's second album is another quixotic sonic parade; lo-fi yet lush, impenetrable yet wholly accessible, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is either the work of a genius or an utter crackpot, with the truth probably falling somewhere in between. Again teaming with producer Robert Schneider, Jeff Mangum invests the material here with new maturity and clarity; while the songs run continuously together, as they did on the previous On Avery Island, there is a much clearer sense of shifting dynamics from track to track, with a greater emphasis on structure and texture. Mangum's vocals are far more emotive as well; whether caught in the rush of spiritual epiphany (&quot;The King of Carrot Flowers Pts. Two and Three&quot;) or in the grip of sexual anxiety (&quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot;), he sings with a new fervor, composed in equal measure of ecstasy and anguish. However, as his musical concepts continue to come into sharper focus, one hopes his stream-of-consciousness lyrical ideas soon begin to do the same; while Mangum spins his words with the rapid-fire intensity of a young Dylan, the songs are far too cryptic and abstract to fully sink in -- In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is undoubtedly a major statement, but just what it's saying is anyone's guess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab84b019e80e9a1afed22dbe068090d8b5893e8","amp;dn":"Neutral+Milk+Hotel+-++In+the+Aeroplane...+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab84b019e80e9a1afed22dbe068090d8b5893e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,184,75,1,158,128,233,161,175,237,34,219,224,104,9,13,139,88,147,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
