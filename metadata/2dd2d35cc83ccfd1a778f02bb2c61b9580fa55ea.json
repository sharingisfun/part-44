Deep in a South African cave, a special team of experts has brought to light an unprecedented wealth of fossils belonging to a crucial gap in the record of our origins that spans the transition between the ape-like australopithecines (such as the famous Lucy) and the earliest members of the human family. At the center of the discovery is paleoanthropologist Lee Berger, a character brimming with enthusiasm and opinions, whose claims have stirred long controversy in the contentious field of human origins. Join NOVA to solve a two million year-old &quot;crime scene&quot; and dig into extraordinary new clues about what made us human.\n\n\n720p\n1hr 53min 09sec\nMKV file\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5016956/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5016956/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dd2d35cc83ccfd1a778f02bb2c61b9580fa55ea","amp;dn":"NOVA.S43E01.Dawn.of.Humanity.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD%5Bbrassetv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dd2d35cc83ccfd1a778f02bb2c61b9580fa55ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,210,211,92,200,60,207,209,167,120,240,43,178,198,27,149,128,250,85,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
