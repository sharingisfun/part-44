Pretty soon they were writing\nand recording their own songs, drawing on influences from\nbluegrass, rock, country and blues. They made their live debut\nin 2004 and by 2005 the band had expanded to include vocalist\nNella Johnson and bass player Tom Wright with drummer, Ru\nShreeve, joining the band in 2006. By 2007 they were playing\nregularly at venues like The Borderline &amp; The Boogaloo and as\nwell as appearing at several festivals including The Camden\nCrawl and The Innocent Festival in Regent's Park. They also\ntoured with Jack Penate and Adele. In March 2008 they were\ninvited to play at the South By South West Festival in Austin\nTexas and in September they played twice at a very muddy\nBestival. Tipped by NME, Time Out and Vogue Magazine as a band\nto watch out for, they are now emerging as one of London's top\ncountry-rock acts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c8833203eaffc82ee630eb3a4564dc9c434e36","amp;dn":"The_Barker_Band-Sorry_For_The_Kissing-2009-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c8833203eaffc82ee630eb3a4564dc9c434e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,200,131,50,3,234,255,200,46,230,48,235,58,69,100,220,156,67,78,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
