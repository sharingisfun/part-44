Influenced by American blues and folk music tradition along with contemporary female singer/songwriters such as PJ Harvey and Kate Bush, she has been compared to Chan Marshall of Cat Power and Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star. &lt;AMG&gt;\n\nFollowing her two critically acclaimed albums Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Dark Undercoat Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» (2008) and Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Victorian America Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» (2009), EMILY JANE WHITE's newest album Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Ode To Sentience Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» was written in San Francisco and Oakland and recorded / mixed in four different studios in the San Francisco bay area by Ross Harris and Emily. \nEmily's latest album Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Victorian America Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» was arranged during rehearsal, this new album was arranged directly in the studio and recorded in a more spontaneous fashion.
