I have found that the one area that my students seemed to always have problems with was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone stepsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (the formalized routines for self defense) required for all belt promotions. It seemed that the students minds went blank when they got up to do the tests and instead of remembering the dozens of one steps they knew they suddenly found themselves stuttering and stammering and falling around the mats doing the same one step again and again or not remembering any at all. I knew that I had taught the students dozens of one steps for the tests and that they had practiced dozens even hundreds of times the one steps, again and again. So why were they forgetting? I realized that it was due to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œoverloadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œover simulationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of their minds with complex one steps that had absolutely no relation to anything they could follow in their minds. \n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d7b956c290f2f4049f664576bd243afd319e8a","amp;dn":"Complete+Book+of+One+Steps+%5BPDF%5D+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d7b956c290f2f4049f664576bd243afd319e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,215,185,86,194,144,242,244,4,159,102,69,118,189,36,58,253,49,158,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
