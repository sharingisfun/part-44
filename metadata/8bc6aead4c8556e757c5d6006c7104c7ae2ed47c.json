He not only takes a close look at the Marine experience during World War II, Korea, and Vietnam - wars in which Krulak was himself a participant - but also examines the foundation on which the Corps is built. In doing so, he helps answer the question of what it means to be a Marine and how the Corps has maintained such a consistently outstanding reputation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc6aead4c8556e757c5d6006c7104c7ae2ed47c","amp;dn":"First+to+Fight.+An+Inside+View+of+the+U.S.+Marine+Corps+-+Victor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc6aead4c8556e757c5d6006c7104c7ae2ed47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,198,174,173,76,133,86,231,87,197,214,0,108,113,4,199,174,46,212,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
