The studies of medical genetics, microbiology, immunology, structural biology, molecular cell biology, neuroscience and developmental biology have been brought to bear on the full range of human diseases. This comprehensive Encyclopedia supplies the reader with concise information on molecular pathophysiology of human disease.\n\nEntries include both defined diseases (such as Parkinson's disease) and pathophysiological entities (such as tremor). The more than 1,200 entries are structured to allow rapid retrieval of information. For more detailed reading, each entry is followed by up to 5 references. The individual entries are written by leading experts in the respective area of research to ensure state-of-the-art descriptions of the mechanisms involved.\n\nThe Encyclopedia is an invaluable companion for clinicians and scientists in all medical disciplines. Moreover, it proves useful for individuals working in related professions or for those simply interested in the mechanisms leading to disease.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Molecular Mechanisms of Disease is readily accessible, both electronically and in print, and will be of great value to both the scientific community and the public.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec96abfe71e348232d3dbba8d15ff8bd3ceb1b4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Encyclopedia+of+Molecular+Mechanisms+of+Disease","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec96abfe71e348232d3dbba8d15ff8bd3ceb1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,201,106,191,231,30,52,130,50,211,219,186,141,21,255,139,211,206,177,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
