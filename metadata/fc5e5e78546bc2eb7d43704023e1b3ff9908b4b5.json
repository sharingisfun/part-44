The series was written by Paul Mendelson and produced by Cinema Verity.\n\nSet in Pinner, London, it revolved around the romance between a widowed solicitor, Alec Callender, played by veteran television actor Anton Rodgers, and a much younger woman, ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Angell, played by Eve Matheson in seasons one and two and by Lesley Dunlop in seasons three through six. Matheson left after the second series due to an offer of a world tour with the National Theatre, including playing Cordelia in King Lear.\n\nThe title of the show comes from the Anderson-Weill song September Song, which is sung during the credits. The titles of all of the episodes of May To December are taken from songs. Most are from musicals, reflecting Alec and ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« 's mutual interest, but some later ones are hits from the 50s and 60s.\n\nCharacters\n\nAlec Callender - (Anton Rodgers) - a widowed, Scottish solicitor who tries to balance his work, his family and his new romance with a much younger woman, ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«. Alec idolises Perry Mason, and has a signed photo reading Cheers Alec, let's crack open a case sometime. Perry. He wishes his cases could be more exciting like Perry's, but instead the most excitement he sees is the occasional divorce.\n\nZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« - (Eve Matheson, series 1-2) &amp; (Lesley Dunlop, series 3-6) - a feisty PE teacher, who divorced her husband after discovering he'd been having an affair. She briefly dated the boys' PE teacher, Roy Morgan Jones, but the relationship is not serious and ends almost as quickly as it began.\n\nMiles Henty (Clive Francis) - Alec's surviving partner (Semple died years earlier though his name is still on the door) who is a bit of a womaniser even though he is married to a sculptress named Annabelle. He initially encourages Alec to take ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« out on a date. He is prominent in the first series and often takes Hillary to lunch, among other places.\n\nJamie Callender (Paul Venables) - Alec's son, was an easy-going bachelor who approved of his relationship with ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«. He has a great sense of humour and seldom ever in a bad mood. He's a bit of a free spirit and lightens any scene he is in. He starts as a law student and takes over for Mr. Henty in as Alec's partner after he gets his licence. He is the polar opposite of his sister.\n\nSimone Callender (Carolyn Pickles) - Alec's daughter. Simone is married to a vicar and has a high moral standard that borders on prudish. She is vehemently opposed to her father's relationship with ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«, especially when they purchase a house a little too close for comfort to the vicarage.\n\nVera Flood - (Frances White) - The senior secretary who comes across as prim and bookish but has secretly written a romance novel using a pseudonym. Her love life isn't as active as the other characters, especially in the beginning, but she eventually marries a man named Gerald Tipple.\n\nHillary - (Rebecca Lacey) - the ditzy and scatterbrained junior secretary. She is the exact opposite in every way to Miss Flood from her personality to the way she dresses. She has a long standing relationship with boyfriend Derek, though she is briefly engaged to Miss Flood's nephew, Anthony. She moves to the Isle of Wight at the end of the fifth series.\n\nDebbie - (Chrissie Cotterill) - ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«'s sister. While she doesn't completely approve of their relationship, she is more tolerant of it then most of the family. She works in her parents' grocery store and has a long term relationship with the much talked about, but never seen Trevor, who works nights. She is primarily ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«'s sounding board.\n\nDot - (Kate Williams) - ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«'s mother. She has quite a bit in common with Alec and likes him, but doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with him. She has infrequent appearances. She owns a greengrocer's with ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«'s father from whom she later separates briefly before reconciling to the strains of Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.\n\nFleur - (Sophie Louise Collinson) (episode 1), (Natalie Boonarec) (episode 2), and (Charlotte Perry) (episodes 3-6) - Alec and ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«'s daughter who is born in the first episode of the fifth series.\n\nRosie - Ashley Jensen - Replaces Hillary. A mad Scotswoman who is always asking: Hoo's yer juices?\n\n\nMay To December S01E01 - It Never Entered My Mind     \nMay To December S01E02 - Fools Rush In     \nMay To December S01E03 - Send In The Clowns     \nMay To December S01E04 - Anything You Can Do     \nMay To December S01E05 - They Didn't Believe Me     \nMay To December S01E06 - There's A Small Hotel     \nMay To December S02E01 - What Kind of Fool Am I     \nMay To December S02E02 - I Remember It Well     \nMay To December S02E03 - You're Driving Me Crazy     \nMay To December S02E04 - Time After Time     \nMay To December S02E05 - There's A Place For Us     \nMay To December S02E06 - No Other Love     \nMay To December S02E07 - My Funny Valentine\nMay To December S02E08 - I'll See You In My Dreams (Christmas Special)     \nMay To December S03E01 - That'll Be The Day     \nMay To December S03E02 - The Look Of Love     \nMay To December S03E03 - Too Close For Comfort     \nMay To December S03E04 - It's All In The Game     \nMay To December S03E05 - The Way You Look Tonight     \nMay To December S03E06 - Feelings     \nMay To December S03E07 - I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plans     \nMay To December S04E01 - This Could Be The Start Of Something Big     \nMay To December S04E02 - Just Like A Woman     \nMay To December S04E03 - I'm Old Fashioned     \nMay To December S04E04 - The Party's Over     \nMay To December S04E05 - The Crying Game     \nMay To December S04E06 - Catch The Bouquet     \nMay To December S05E01 - Splish Splash     \nMay To December S05E02 - Baby Love     \nMay To December S05E03 - School Days     \nMay To December S05E04 - Who Can I Turn To     \nMay To December S05E05 - Let There Be Love     \nMay To December S05E06 - The Best Is Yet To Come     \nMay To December S06E01 - Nice Work If You Can Get It     \nMay To December S06E02 - Take Good Care Of My Baby     \nMay To December S06E03 - Son Of My Father     \nMay To December S06E04 - Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White     \nMay To December S06E05 - Let The Heartaches Begin     \nMay To December S06E06 - Until It's Time For You To Go \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc5e5e78546bc2eb7d43704023e1b3ff9908b4b5","amp;dn":"May+to+December+-+BBC+Comedy+Series+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc5e5e78546bc2eb7d43704023e1b3ff9908b4b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,94,94,120,84,107,194,235,125,67,112,64,35,225,179,255,153,8,180,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
