The show is set in the fictional city of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society, \ntelevision and many aspects of the human condition.\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, \nbecoming the first Fox series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1990).\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989 the show has broadcast 473 episodes and the twenty-second season started airing on September 26, 2010. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and grossed US$527 million worldwide.\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, 27 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest running American primetime entertainment series. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase &quot;D'oh!&quot; has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.\nFrom: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons\n--------------\nScreemshoots\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  _______________________________________________________________________________\n |                               Some screenshoots                               |\n               |\n                |\n               |\n               |\n |                                                                               |\n |                                                                               |\n |                                                                               |\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4b14316e79ad30a4cbf028655f22ea9eebb416","amp;dn":"The.Simpsons.S02.inComplet6-22.RoDubbed-WeGotYou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4b14316e79ad30a4cbf028655f22ea9eebb416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,75,20,49,110,121,173,48,164,203,240,40,101,95,34,234,158,235,180,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
