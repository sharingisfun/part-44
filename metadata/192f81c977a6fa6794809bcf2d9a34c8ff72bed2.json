A disturbing, witty, and electrifying drama, the film won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Picture. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a misbehaved con who shirks authority, finds himself in an asylum after faking insanity to get out of work detail in prison.

It's not long before McMurphy is reaching out to his new inmates, trying desperately to bring life to an otherwise dead atmosphere.
