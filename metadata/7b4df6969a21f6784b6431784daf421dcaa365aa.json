In her life. In her body. And now in an eating-disorder treatment center on the dusty outskirts of the New Mexico desert.\n\nLife in the center is regimented and intrusive, a nightmare come true. Nurses and therapists watch Stevie at mealtime, accompany her to the bathroom, and challenge her to eat the foods sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked so hard to avoid.\n\nHer dad has signed her up for sixty days of treatment. But what no one knows is that Stevie doesn't plan to stay that long. There are only twenty-seven days until the anniversary of her brother JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deathÃ¢â‚¬â€the death she caused. And if Stevie gets her way, there are only twenty-seven days until she too will end her life.\n\nIn this emotionally haunting and beautifully written young adult debut, Meg Haston delves into the devastating impact of trauma and loss, while posing the question: Why are some consumed by their illness while others embark on a path toward recovery ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4df6969a21f6784b6431784daf421dcaa365aa","amp;dn":"Paperweight+-+Meg+Haston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b4df6969a21f6784b6431784daf421dcaa365aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,77,246,150,154,33,246,120,75,100,49,120,77,175,66,29,202,163,101,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
