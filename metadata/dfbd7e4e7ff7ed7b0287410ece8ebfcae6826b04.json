IS IT AN ELECTRONIC ALBUM? WELL??? \nIT'S BOTH!!! \nZonK's debut album, an &quot;electronic soundtrack&quot; to the bong smoking dice game, is a cornucopia of mixed electronic blends, analog synths, dumped in a hazy smoke filled room. Twelve instrumental tracks provide the mood to sit back, roll some dice, and smoke some herb. These songs will uplift your day to new heights, complete with all you need to start a game of ZonK with your friends. Smoketronic music for the soul. \n\nFive Dice are included in the spine of the phyiscal release of the album. Rules are included in both physical and downloadable releases. \n\nzonk.bandcamp.com &amp;for more info and remixes from the band ZonK and also help and information on playing the dice game ZonK with your friends. \n\nAges 18+ \n2-8 Players Preferred \n\nZonK endorses the right of responsible adults to use marijuana as a medical and spiritual tool. And of course for fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfbd7e4e7ff7ed7b0287410ece8ebfcae6826b04","amp;dn":"ZonK+-+The+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfbd7e4e7ff7ed7b0287410ece8ebfcae6826b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,189,126,78,127,247,237,123,2,135,65,14,206,142,191,202,230,130,107,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
