Pulling from influences like Philip\nGlass, Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Borden, among others, and using\ninstitutional architecture and 70s Canadiana as a framework, the EP has a\ndistinctly 20th century feel.\n\nOpener &quot;1 (Entry)&quot; lures us in with a melancholy bed of synths, while\nstandout &quot;3 (Building)&quot;'s rolling piano melodies build to a cathartic\ncrescendo. The lone vocal piece, &quot;5 (September)&quot;, is a cover of the opener\nto David Sylvian's 'Secrets of the Beehive' album, refitted with 2-step\npercussion and wintry pads. This is a change of pace for CFCF to be sure,\nbut no less cinematic and evocative than his 2009 debut 'Continent', though\nwhere that record evoked long stretches of neon road and epic rainforests,\n'Exercises' is all snowy walkways and long corridors, endless escalators\nascending to desolate concrete plateaus. Each track feels like an\nexploration of lost memories, studies in nostalgia, exercises in spatial\nremembrance.\n\n'Exercises' is available on LIMITED EDITION 180 GRAM Vinyl (CD Included) and\ndigitally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74a6393d51883eed603cb9a6294699d40009bbf","amp;dn":"CFCF-Exercise-2012-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74a6393d51883eed603cb9a6294699d40009bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,74,99,147,213,24,131,238,214,3,203,154,98,148,105,157,64,0,155,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
