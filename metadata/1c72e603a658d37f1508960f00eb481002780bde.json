The TV series is made by Isis Productions and distributed by Eagle Rock Entertainment. It is shown on various broadcasters including BBC, ITV, Sky Arts, VH1 and VH1 Classic. They are also available on DVD. The show is similar in structure to VH1's short-lived 2001 series, Ultimate Albums.\n\nThe music, and its production, is dissected by the musicians and/or producer playing the multitrack recordings and singling out tracks that one does not usually consciously hear when listening to the music, giving insight into the way the sound is built up. Also, the individual musicians play back pieces, which are then blended with the original recording. Almost all songs are dealt with, focusing almost entirely on the music itself, how it was composed/realised. Personal aspects of the band or members are occasionally dealt with, but mostly only if they serve this purpose. TV episodes are 50 minutes long but the DVD releases contain much additional material. All the releases in this series are done with the co-operation and full authorisation of the artists involved. The Series Producers are Nick de Grunwald and Martin R Smith. Various Directors have been used for the series but the majority of the programmes have been directed by Bob Smeaton, Matthew Longfellow and Jeremy Marre. The most recent episodes in the series cover Black Sabbath - Paranoid, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers - Damn the Torpedoes, and Rush - 2112 &amp; Moving Pictures. These were released in mid-2010, and were also released on the Blu-ray Disc format.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/3051/machineheaddvd201003031.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/3051/machineheaddvd201003031.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Crediti :.\n\nRegista: Matthew Longfellow\n\nRitchie Blackmore\t... \tSe stesso\n\tChris Charlesworth\t... \tSe stesso\n\tIan Gillan\t... \tSe stesso\n\tRoger Glover\t... \tSe stesso\n\tJon Lord\t... \tSe stesso\n\tIan Paice\t... \tSe stesso\n\tBrad Tolinski\t... \tSe stesso\n\tChris Welch\t... \tSe stesso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c72e603a658d37f1508960f00eb481002780bde","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Machine+Head+%5BDVDrip+-+Eng+Ac3+Sub+IT-DE-PO-NL-FR-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c72e603a658d37f1508960f00eb481002780bde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,114,230,3,166,88,211,127,21,8,150,15,0,235,72,16,2,120,11,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
