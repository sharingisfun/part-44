Two additional tunes and the only existing four alternate takes from the sessions have been added here as a bonus.\r\n\r\nIt's easy and perhaps unfair to take any later jazz album by a trendy, &quot;hot&quot; trumpeter and compare it to a classic like Have Trumpet, Will Excite!. Critics and fans have been afforded the luxury of time to weed out half-efforts. Still, even without former knowledge of who Dizzy Gillespie is, Have Trumpet, Will Excite! separates itself from the crowd pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nThe Latin up-tempo arrangement of &quot;My Heart Belongs to Daddy&quot; thrusts the song into an entirely different realm. Junior Mance's piano kicks things of with a quirky, forceful rhythm, and after Gillespie's trumpet lays down the bare bones of the melody, it's pretty much forgotten. From there, the band takes off on a creative surge. The same is true of &quot;My Man.&quot; A brave arrangement, kicked off by piano and outlined by trumpet, completely rewrites the piece. &quot;Sure,&quot; Gillespie and the band, seem to say, &quot;We can play old swing tunes, but wouldn't it be cool if we turned them inside out?&quot; This approach, along with sharp solos, gives the material an exciting edge. \r\n\r\nGillespie's solo on &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; just soars, while Les Spann, who plays both flute and guitar on the album, follows him with a bristly guitar solo. Mance offers distinctive piano work that matches Gillespie's enthusiasm on tunes like &quot;Woody 'N' You,&quot; while bassist Sam Jones and drummer Lex Humphries keep a high-octane rhythm in constant motion. Have Trumpet, Will Excite! more than measures up to its promise and stands as a cornerstone of Gillespie's '50s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded in New York, February 17-20, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - My Heart Belongs To Daddy\r\n02 - My Man\r\n03 - Moonglow\r\n04 - ST.
