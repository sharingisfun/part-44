The purpose of this book is to create the first comprehensive resource on the theory and applications of isoconversional methodology. The book introduces the reader to the kinetics of physical and chemical condensed phase processes that occur as a result of changing temperature and discusses how isoconversional analysis can provide important kinetic insights into them. The book will help the readers to develop a better understanding of the methodology, and promote its efficient usage and successful development.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nProfessor Sergey Vyazovkin received his Ph.D. from the Byelorussian State University in 1989. He then joined the Institute for Physical Chemistry (Minsk) where he worked until 1993. Since 1993 he had held visiting positions at the Technical University of Vienna, the University of Toledo, and the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis. Before joining the University of Alabama at Birmingham, he worked in the University of Utah as a research faculty and the deputy director of the Center for Thermal Analysis. His research interests are concerned with the application of thermal analysis methods to thermally stimulated processes in a wide variety of condensed phase systems. He is a winner of Mettler-Toledo Award in thermal analysis and of James J. Christensen Award in calorimetry. Prof. Vyazovkin is editor of Thermochimica Acta and a member of the editorial board of Macromolecular Rapid Communications and Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics. He is a member of the American Chemical Society Analytical Division, the North American Thermal Analysis Society, and the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e0795180bb9523c48f5387b0909a59b0ce1281","amp;dn":"Isoconversional+Kinetics+of+Thermally+Stimulated+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e0795180bb9523c48f5387b0909a59b0ce1281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,224,121,81,128,187,149,35,196,143,83,135,176,144,154,89,176,206,18,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
