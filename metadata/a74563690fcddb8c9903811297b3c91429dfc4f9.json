Scraps (3:23)\n\nRecorded after a stint in the remote artistic desert community of Marfa in Texas, the third album by Londoner Dan Michaelson, formerly of Absentee, is rich with flashes of southern pedal steel, which give life to the otherwise threadbare set-up of piano, guitar and occasional cello. Stripped to near-silence in parts, the nine tracks are executed with elegance and precision, and the warm rumble of Michaelson's molasses-thick voice make even the simplest of sentiments sound profound. However, repeated listens suggest this bare-bones approach isn't quite so successful when it comes to his lyrics. Thematically, the songs teeter on the precipice of making a relationship work or chucking it all in, but feel too broad and open for the emotional clout the music demands.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74563690fcddb8c9903811297b3c91429dfc4f9","amp;dn":"Dan+Michaelson+-+Sudden+Fiction+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74563690fcddb8c9903811297b3c91429dfc4f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,69,99,105,15,205,219,140,153,3,129,18,151,179,201,20,41,223,196,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
