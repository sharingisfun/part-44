Does time always flow forward? Is the universe unendingâ€”or are there boundaries? Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends?\r\n\r\nTold in language we all can understand, A Brief History of Time plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and â€œarrows of time,â€ of the big bang and a bigger Godâ€”where the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48eed9166b538eef00753110f7960db9da9f94c9","amp;dn":"A+Brief+History+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48eed9166b538eef00753110f7960db9da9f94c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,238,217,22,107,83,142,239,0,117,49,16,247,150,13,185,218,159,148,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
