A unique integration of macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic illustrations help readers visualize the various dimensions of chemistry; and TroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s engaging writing style captures the reader's attention with relevant applications. MasteringChemistry walks readers through problem solving, while promoting understanding of chemistry concepts in the world around us.\nMatter, Measurement, and Problem Solving; Atoms and Elements; Molecules, Compounds, and Chemical Equations; Chemical Quantities and Aqueous Reactions; Gases; Thermochemistry; The Quantum-Mechanical Model of the Atom; Periodic Properties of the Elements; Chemical Bonding I: Lewis Theory; Chemical Bonding II: Molecular Shapes, Valence Bond Theory, and Molecular Orbital Theory; Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces; Solutions; Chemical Kinetics; Chemical Equilibrium; Acids and Bases; Aqueous Ionic Equilibrium; Free Energy and Thermodynamics; Electrochemistry; Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry; Organic Chemistry.\nA useful reference for anyone who needs to increase his or her knowledge of general chemistry.\n\nAbout the Author\nNivaldo Tro is a Professor of Chemistry at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, where he has been a faculty member since 1990. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford University for work on developing and using optical techniques to study the adsorption and desorption of molecules to and from surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum. He then went on to the University of California at Berkeley, where he did postdoctoral research on ultrafast reaction dynamics in solution. Since coming to Westmont, Professor Tro has been awarded grants from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, from Research Corporation, and from the National Science Foundation to study the dynamics of various processes occurring in thin adlayer films adsorbed on dielectric surfaces. He has been honored as Westmont's outstanding teacher of the year three times and has also received the college's outstanding researcher of the year award. Professor Tro enjoys surfing, biking, being outdoors with his family, and reading good books to his children.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 888 pages\n    * Publisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (January 15, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0321560043\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0321560049\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b196441c9508d66b7af63e5e504ba5d2f84fc511","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Chemistry%3A+A+Molecular+Approach%2C1st+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b196441c9508d66b7af63e5e504ba5d2f84fc511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,150,68,28,149,8,214,107,122,246,62,94,80,75,165,210,248,79,197,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
