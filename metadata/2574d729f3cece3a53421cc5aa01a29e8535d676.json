TPB's trackers are down. But I've been anticipating something like this for a while. So for those who'll want to download torrents I've made and will make in the future, I'm moving nearly all of them to another torrent-site, maybe two. I guess it'll be at least: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJust browse for the torrents on that site, and all uploads will come up, just give me some days.. :-)\n\nAnd you can still start your download from this site!! Just add these trackers to the torrent, and we'll find each other again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n \nNow don't click on the &quot;links&quot; above, that won't work. Copy and paste them to add them to your trackers in the torrent-file.\n\nAnd be sure to enable DHT. It tracks too..\n  \nAnyway, they should also all be available by search on my alias, verifire, on for instance: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&lt;/a&gt;\n \n- because they search the contents and comments on the upload for tags as well as the title of the torrent.. Just give me some time..\n\nSee you later, when things are settled and (maybe) there's a working tracker on the site again, and I'll miss it terribly, but I hope for, and guess this isn't the last word on the matter. I'll upload stuff here anyway, as well as on the other sites...\n\nTPB WILL ALWAYS RULE!! THANK YOU, GUYS. YOU'VE BEEN A PLEASURE TO BE SHIPWRECKED WITH. IT'S AN HONOR...\n\nVerifire.\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nI'm at the moment being constantly monitored and hindered in sharing Christian material. For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nThanks to &quot;2nafish&quot;, I found this high resolution .mpg video of what's come to be known as Johnny Cash's epitaph. It's from the &quot;American IV - The Man Comes Around&quot; -album, the last he ever did before leaving us to be with his Lord and Saviour, The Man in white, Jesus of Nazareth..\n\nI converted it to DivX in good quality, and now you can watch it on TV, or show to others on the TV, instead of gathering around the often not-so-comfortable surroundings of a computer..\n\n..Plus DivX takes up a lot less space than .mpg.. :-)\n\nGreetings from\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2e584b5c4748475c4b434f47426e49434f4742004d4143&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2574d729f3cece3a53421cc5aa01a29e8535d676","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+Hurt+%40720x480+%5B2002%5D+-+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2574d729f3cece3a53421cc5aa01a29e8535d676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,116,215,41,243,206,206,58,83,66,28,197,170,1,162,158,133,53,214,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
