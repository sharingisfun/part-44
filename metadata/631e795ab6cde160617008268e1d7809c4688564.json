Follow Isabelle and her family as they go about their day. Isabelle's family do not speak English so she will translate everything for you. We join Isabelle, her brother Pierre and baby sister Sophie as they wake up. After a chaotic breakfast, it's off to Grandma and Grandpa's. Then a trip to the shops and a visit to the park introduce lots of familiar objects. After a busy and fun-filled day, it's home to play, bath time and bed. To add to the fun, there is a little yellow duck to find in every scene. This animated introduction to French makes learning a language simple for young children and fun for all the family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631e795ab6cde160617008268e1d7809c4688564","amp;dn":"First+Fun+With+French","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631e795ab6cde160617008268e1d7809c4688564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,30,121,90,182,205,225,96,97,112,8,38,142,29,120,9,196,104,133,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
