Spyker\n\nWritten in part to promote Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, Schlafly's book is also an astounding revelation of back room politics. For decades, groups of industry leaders created a web of influence specifically designed to defraud the American people of free elections at the highest level.
