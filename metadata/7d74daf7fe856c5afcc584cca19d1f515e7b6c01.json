I've added a flash animation by the renowned dutch animator Hoogerbrugge, who created Spin for the Playstation 2 website. You have to open the animation in your browser and interact with it. Another non traditional but fantastic animation in this torrent  is the Fireplace screensaver, shared for free by the great Pez around the holiday season, and I am sharing it here (it's also available from http://www.eatpes.com). For more taditional animations, I've included the first Disney Silly Symphony, the skeleton dance from 1929. Kawamato's version of sleeping beauty is a bit different than what you might expect. His puppet movies are all very lovely, and this one was made in Jiri Trnka's studio in Prague (see part 10 for Trnka's own work). Pablo Zaramella is back in this part with a very enjoyable claymation Journey To Mars. Claymation fans will also be happy with Sapegin's Mons the Cat and Wallace and Grommit's latest short. I've added powers of ten by the Eames brothers - maybe only barely an animation, but I recently saw it again at a film festival and thought it would be nice to add it here as well, because it's a great classic. Two of the shorts in Part 14 (Presto and Oktopodi) were nominated for an academy award - I included Konstatin Bronzit's Lavatory Lovestory and Kunio Kato's La Maison en Petits Cubes in this part. Bronzit has featured in many parts of this animation festival, but Kato has some more interesting animations which I might include in the future. I hope you will enjoy all the other widely different, but excellent quality animations as well. \n\nFinally, for those who are looking for previous editions, please check out this torrent:It includes parts 1 to 13, and was collected by Sataneev. For a beautiful longer animation, check out Nina Paley's Sita Sings The Blues, which is available under creative commonse license here: http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/\n\nPrevious Festival Editions:\n\nPart 1:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar's Short Animation Festival\n          *  25 Ways To Quit Smoking (1989) Bill Plympton.avi (25 megabyte)\n          *  Au Bout Du Monde - Konstantin Bronzit (1998).avi (101.59 megabyte)\n          *  Balance - Lauenstein (1989).avi (49.33 megabyte)\n          *  Birthday.Boy.2004.avi (98.96 megabyte)\n          *  Blackfly - Christopher Hinton (1991) - .avi (56.9 megabyte)\n          *  Bunny - Blue Sky Chris Wedge (1998) Oscar Short Animated Film 1997.avi (93.04 megabyte)\n          *  Cowboys.(Phil.Mulloy,1991).avi (170 megabyte)\n          *  Crac - Frederic Back (1980).avi (137.5 megabyte)\n          *  Father and Daughter - Oscar Short Animated Film 2000 8'08.avi (36.75 megabyte)\n          *  Gopher Broke - Blur Studio Jeff Fowler (2004).avi (165.23 megabyte)\n          *  Harvie Krumpet (2003).avi (186.29 megabyte)\n          *  Intolerance &amp; Intolerance II - Phil Mulloy (2000 &amp; 2001).avi (242 megabyte)\n          *  Mike's New Car - Pixar.avi (59.47 megabyte)\n          *  More - Mark Osborne (1998).avi (177.79 megabyte)\n          *  Pixar - Ice Age Extra(Gone Nutty).avi (40.89 megabyte)\n          *  Rejected - Don Hertzfeldt - 2000.avi (98.44 megabyte)\n          *  Rocks.Das.Rad.Germany-pp.avi (62.74 megabyte)\n          *  Special Delivery - John Weldon &amp; Eunice Macaulay (1978).avi (75.12 megabyte)\n          *  Strange Invaders.-.2004.avi (66.31 megabyte)\n          *  Tango - Zbigniew Rybczynski (1982).avi (42.69 megabyte)\n          *  The Big Snit - Richard Condie (1985).avi (78.49 megabyte)\n          *  The Fly - Oscar Short Animated Film 1980 3'00.avi (18.98 megabyte)\n          *  The Old Lady And The Pigeons - Sylvain Chomet (1998).avi (136.93 megabyte)\n          *  The Periwig-Maker - Schaffler (1999).avi (119.57 megabyte)\n          *  The Sandman - Paul Berry - (1991).avi (69.2 megabyte)\n          *  The.Cathedral.Poland-pp.avi (50.79 megabyte)\n          *  Vincent - Tim.Burton.avi (63.22 megabyte)\n          *  Ward 13 (2003).avi (190.28 megabyte)\n\nPart 2:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 2\n          *  Alison Snowden &amp; David Fine (1987) - George and Rosemary.avi (96.62 megabyte)\n          *  Arkelope - Roslyn Schwartz (1994).mpg (51.57 megabyte)\n          *  Calypso is like so - Bruno Collet (2003).avi (103.45 megabyte)\n          *  Chris Landreth - Bingo The Clown (1998).avi (33.47 megabyte)\n          *  Fedorenco and Lamb - Every Child (1979).avi (61.26 megabyte)\n          *  Grasshoppers - Bruno Bozzetto (1990).avi (48.91 megabyte)\n          *  Konstantin Bronzit - Switchcraft (1994).avi (34 megabyte)\n          *  Luxo Jr - Pixar (1986).avi (33.09 megabyte)\n          *  Sex &amp; Violence - Bill Plympton.avi (42.95 megabyte)\n          *  The Metamorphosis of Mr. Samsa - Caroline Leaf (1977).avi (79.37 megabyte)\n          *  Voyage To Next - Faith &amp; John Hubley (1974).avi (147.51 megabyte)\n\n\nPart 3:\n\nContents of download:\n\n    * Folder icon Beltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 3\n          *  Bill Plympton - The fan and the flower (2005) - Narrated by Paul Giamatti.avi (83.77 megabyte)\n          *  Fallen Art (Tomek Baginski, 2004).avi (142.61 megabyte)\n          *  Ferenc Cak? - Stones (2000).avi (102.35 megabyte)\n          *  Flatlife - Jonas Geirnaert (2004).avi (73.33 megabyte)\n          *  Georges Schwizgebel - Les Jeune Fille Et Les Nuages (2000).avi (52.9 megabyte)\n          *  Matt Abbiss - Play (2003).avi (12.5 megabyte)\n          *  Norman McLaren - Lines Horizontal (1962).avi (100.05 megabyte)\n          *  Raoul Servais - Siren (1968).avi (110 megabyte)\n          *  Sven Martin - Ritterschlag (2003).avi (50.03 megabyte)\n          *  The Chain - Phill Mulloy (1997).avi (97.08 megabyte)\n\nPart 4:\n\nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 4\n\n    *  Blur Studio - In The Rough (2004).avi (230.62 megabyte)\n    *  Bruno Bozzetto - Baeus (1987).avi (80.11 megabyte)\n    *  Genre - Don Hertzfeldt (1996).avi (19.56 megabyte)\n    *  Joanna Quinn (1996) - Famous Fred.avi (298.99 megabyte)\n    *  Peter Lord (1996) - Wat'S Pig.avi (122.93 megabyte)\n    *  Pjotr Sapegin - Huset Pa Kampen (1998).avi (49.08 megabyte)\n    *  Ring Of Fire - Andreas Hykade (2000).avi (230.96 megabyte)\n    *  The Mermaid - Aleksandr Petrov (1997).avi (120.6 megabyte)\n    *  The Monk and the Fish - Dudok de Wit (1994).avi (89.35 megabyte)\n\nPart 5:\n\nThis time, I have been especially good to you.

Alltogether it's over 3 hours worth of material. It will take a while to download, but trust me: it's worth it.\n\nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 5\n\n    *  9 - Shane Acker (2005).avi (90.92 megabyte)\n    *  A Grand Day Out - Wallace &amp; Grommit 1991.avi (181.86 megabyte)\n    *  Angry Kid - Peter Lord.avi (23.09 megabyte)\n    *  Annie and Boo (2004) Johannes Weilund.avi (251.42 megabyte)\n    *  Badgered (2005) Sharon Colman.avi (38.39 megabyte)\n    *  Bill Plympton - The Exciting Life Of A Tree.avi (47.21 megabyte)\n    *  Bob's Birthday - Allison Snowden &amp; David Fine.avi (102.7 megabyte)\n    *  Charade - Minnis - 1984.avi (13.13 megabyte)\n    *  Chris Landreth - Ryan (2004).avi (149.84 megabyte)\n    *  Konstantin Bronzit (2003) - The God.avi (33.03 megabyte)\n    *  La Linea 145 (Cavandoli).avi (22.54 megabyte)\n    *  Michael Sieber - Wunderwerk (2002).avi (80.11 megabyte)\n    *  Norman McLaren - Neighbours (1952).avi (126.83 megabyte)\n    *  Pedro Serrazina - Tale About the Cat and the Moon (1995).avi (55.39 megabyte)\n    *  Raoul Servais - Chromophobia (1966).avi (109.33 megabyte)\n    *  Richard Condie - The Apprentice (1991).avi (85.5 megabyte)\n    *  Ring - Anna and Bella - 1984.avi (35.03 megabyte)\n    *  Ryan Larkin - Syrinx (1965).avi (22.03 megabyte)\n    *  Suzie Templeton - Dog.avi (16.42 megabyte)\n    *  The History of the World - Phil Mulloy (1994).avi (54.73 megabyte)\n    *  The Man With The Beautiful Eyes - (Charles Bukowski).avi (102.24 megabyte)\n    *  The Mysterious Geographic Explorations Of Jasper Morello Pdtv Xvid.avi (175.05 megabyte)\n    *  The.End.of.the.World.in.Four.Seasons - Paul van Driessen.avi (278.19 megabyte)\n    *  Tim Webb - A Is For Autism (1992).avi (99.17 megabyte)\n    *  Wendy Tilby (1991) - Strings.avi (116.4 megabyte)\n\nPart 6:\n\nI am spoiling you, I realise, but here is anotherpart of my animation short film festival. This time I have some funnyshort for you (Cousin, The Chubbchubbs, Do It yourself Cartoon Kit,Poumse), some more serious animations (Le Chapeau, Pad, Illusion) andsome simply weird ones but great to watch (Cat Soup &amp; Karl &amp; Marilyn).

I included one of the oldest animations ever byWinston McCay from 1911, a silly symphonies from 1934 and the excellentThree Blind Mice by Dunning (who would later direct Yellow Submarine).Besides these, there are some animations I personally like fromstudents or small production companies. Rosto A.D. is an impressivegroup (check their website) Le Building is probably the best shortunder 2 minutes I have ever seen, and Inventaire Fantome reminds me alot of Jasper Morello I included in Part 5 (sorry for those who don'tspeak french, but I think you will still enjoy it). I added some betterknown animators for those who don't like the less known stuff, likeAlkabetz, Bozzetto, the lesser known Killing an Egg (which isn't evenmentioned on IMDB) by Driessen (who actually worked as an animator onthe Yellow Submarine as well, but anyway), Aldeshin and Brakhage. Jojo in the Stars is a very atmospheric animaton which I like a lot as well.Hope you enjoy this selection. My hard drive (40 GB) is being taken upby all these animations (over 10 GB); most likely I will put up one more part and then stop for a while.

I included more mainstream animations like A Greek Tragedy, Self Service, When The Day Breaks, and Bill Plymbton's Push comes to Shove. There are 3 longer animations, Daniel Greaves' Flatworld, The Cunning Little Vixen (a nice BBC production) and Zbrodnia i Kara (Crime and Punishment) by Dumala. There are more eastern European animators in this torrent, the unknown Gary Seko and Michaela Pavlatova. From Japan comes the godfather of manga, Osamu Tezuka with his nice short Jumping. Alltogether I hope you will like the collection, and I hope I could interest some more people in short animated films.\n\n    *    78 Tours (Georges Schwizgebel, 1985).avi\tVideo\t31.13 M\n    *    Amanda Forbis, Wendy Tilby - When the Day Breaks (1999).mpg\tVideo\t94.43 M\n    *    Aubier &amp; Patar - Babyroussa, the Babiroussa.avi\tVideo\t86.02 M\n    *    Bill Plympton - Push Comes To Shove (1991).avi\tVideo\t155.98 M\n    *    Brad Caslor &amp; Christopher Hinton - Blowhard.mpg\tVideo\t92.72 M\n    *    Bruno Bozzetto - Self Service.avi\tVideo\t92.29 M\n    *    Christmas (1996) Mikhail Aldashin.avi\tVideo\t179.83 M\n    *    Daniel Greaves (1997) Flatworld.avi\tVideo\t311.62 M\n    *    Disney - 1953 - Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom.mpg\tVideo\t102.92 M\n    *    Don Hertzfeldt - Intermission.avi\tVideo\t35.18 M\n    *    Evelyn Lambart (1974) Mr. Frog Went A-Courting.mpg\tVideo\t43.9 M\n    *    Garik Seko (1982) Ex Libris.avi\tVideo\t93.87 M\n    *    John Halas (1963) Automania 2000.avi\tVideo\t77.88 M\n    *    Jolly Roger - Mark Baker (1998).avi\tVideo\t68.38 M\n    *    Osamu Tezuka (1984) Jumping.avi\tVideo\t25.27 M\n    *    Piotr Dumala - Zbrodnia i Kara (2000).avi\tVideo\t354.78 M\n    *    Quest - Tyron Montgomery &amp; Thomas Stellmach (1996).asf\tVideo\t24.44 M\n    *    Repeat (1995) Pavlatova.avi\tVideo\t123.94 M\n    *    Suzan Pitt (1973) - Jefferson Circus Songs.avi\tVideo\t95.25 M\n    *    The Cunning Little Vixen (2003) Geoff Dunbar.avi\tVideo\t400.02 M\n    *    Van Goethem (1986) A Greek Tragedy.avi\tVideo\t32.45 M\n    *    Winsor McCay - 1912 - How A Mosquito Operates.avi\tVideo\t38.18 M\n\nPart 9\n\nAfter almost one year, I have decided to celebrate the first year aniversary of Beltesassar's Short Animation Festival with a new torrent. After putting out 8 torrents with approximately 135 excellent animations, I received a lot of thank you's from people who were very grateful they could finallt (once again) see some short animations the really wanted to see. For all the people that made requests for animations, I have made this torrent. It contains all the video's I have which people requested for. Like L'Homme Sans Ombre by George Schwizgebel and Walking, by Ryan Larkin. Three currently Oscar nominated Short Animation are in here: Scrat (getting less and less funny), Little Matchgirl (Disney is getting more and more traditional) and Maestro, a funny short building up to one great joke: but I hope and think Torill Kove will win. \nI included some recent animations, for example Overtime, which has a very nice atmosphere and which I found was quite enjoyable - it won the OIAF award for best graduate film, and The Cags, by Alexei Petrov (Note this is not Aleksandr Petrov, whose Old Man and the Sea I might add to part 10). I added 2 movies from the Arnaud Demuynck production house, Signes de Vie, a dark and sad animation with a hapy ending, made by Arnaud Demuynck, and Chahut, made by Gilles Cuvelier. I also added Vent by Erik van Schaaik, because he's dutch just like me and the movie is doing really well on international festivals. Humdrum by Peter Peake was nominated for an Oscar, as was Quest. But let's be honest, the folks at the Oscar really don't have a clue about what's worthwhile in short animation: there are a lot better recent animations that never got nominated to begin with. Morir de Amor for example, or Rabbit by Run Wrake. Or how about the lovely animated romantic comedy in 9 mnutes A Backbone Tale by Jeremy Clapin? I also added a video clip: one of the few places in popular culture animation still has a prominent place, and have chosen for Good Song by Blur, animated by Snynola, for which they got the McLaren animation award in 2004. I added some unknown animators who made nice animations, and finally, I included some better known animators: Paul van Driessen, Michael Dudok de Wit, Suzan Pitt and Don Hertzfeldt, which I'm sure you'll like, but who are slightly overclassed by younger artists in this torrent, I have to admit. Keep an eye out for part 10: it's coming. Also, have patience with the upload: I might not be online the whole day. \n\n \nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 9\n\n    *   Ryan Larkin - Walking (1968).avi (59.91 megabyte)\n    *   Gil Alkabetz - Morir de Amor.avi (178.16 megabyte)\n    *   Gilles Cuvelier - Chahut (2005).avi (116.4 megabyte)\n    *   Georges Schwizgebel - L'homme sans ombre (2004).avi (88.61 megabyte)\n    *   Michael Dudok de Wit - The Aroma of Tea (2006).avi (40.41 megabyte)\n    *   Frank &amp; Caroline Mouris - Frank Film (1973).avi (180.34 megabyte)\n    *   Tyron Montgomery &amp; Thomas Stellmach - Quest (1996).avi (73.46 megabyte)\n    *   Piotr Duma?a - Franz Kafka (1991).avi (179.63 megabyte)\n    *   Paul Driessen - Au bout du fil (Cat's Craddle) (1974).avi (120.01 megabyte)\n    *   Marcell Jankovics - Sisyphus (1974) .avi (24.49 megabyte)\n    *   Michael Theodore - Color Dream no.246 (2006).avi (23.39 megabyte)\n    *   Don Hertzfeldt - The Meaning of Life (2005).avi (125.58 megabyte)\n    *   Arnaud Demuynck - Signes de Vie (2004).avi (124.84 megabyte)\n    *   Suzan Pitt - Asparagus (1978).avi (110.19 megabyte)\n    *   Erik van Schaaik - Vent (2004) .avi (40.17 megabyte)\n    *   Alexei Petrov - The Cags (2005).avi (21.78 megabyte)\n    *   Atlan Berland Ferrie - Overtime (2005).avi (72.01 megabyte)\n    *   Jeremy Clapin - Une Histoire Vertebrale (A Backbone Tale) (2006).avi (93.15 megabyte)\n    *   Pixar - Scrat No Time For Nuts (2006).avi (75.98 megabyte)\n    *   GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©za M.

I added Yuri Norstein's Hedgehog in the Fog. He's one of the best animations artists ever, and has been very influential throughout his career, not only on russian animations, but japanese artists as well. I didn't include any of his animations in earlier versions, but might add his masterpiece Tale of Tales in the next torrent I make. A second major russion animator, Aleksander Petrov, has made the Hemmingway novel The Old Man and the Sea in a beautiful animation. Each frame was made using slow-drying oil paints upon a back-lit glass &quot;canvass.&quot; With his fingers, Director Aleksandr Petrov manipulated the oils between frames and photographed the results, then gently molding the oils for the next frame to repeat the process. The short won an oscar in 2000, and although this big version increases the download size of this torrent substantially, I thought it would be worth it. Ever watched a Monty Python movie and wondered who made the animations in them? Well, it's Terry Gilliam, and Storytime shows how clearly he contributed to the Monty Python humor and more importantly, the visuals of Monty Python movies (it was made before he joined Monty Python). In the short Mindscape, Drouin creates a beautiful short using a pinscreen: small pins which can be pressed up or down, and when the whole is lit from the side, light and dark area's are visible. Developped by Alexandre Alexeieff in the 20's, Drouin mastered this techinque and put in and unbelievable amount of time to create this gem. As an ode to independent film making, I included the classic Bambi Meets Godzilla (in 1969, before we had YouTube, this was all you needed for world fame). L'homme aux bras ballants is a nice black and white short (similar in feel and speed to Overtime in part 9) created by Gordiard, who was also one of the animators working on The Cat and the Moon (Part 5). Tyger by Guilherme Marcondes is one of the most interesting shorts I've seen in a while, I really loved it. There are some animators also included in earlier editions with other work (Chris Landreth, Michaela Pavlatova, Ryan Larkin), one of the oldest animations ever (by Cohl), a nice experimental short by Hebert inspired by simple mathemmatics, and a short by a cool young animator Arthur de Pins whose movies are doing really well on international festivals. Part 11 is almost done as well, and will be online shortly. As always, have some patience with the download, I'm not online that often, but will share this torrent for months. Thanks for those writing nice things about these torrents on their blogs. \t\t\n\n    * Hedgehog in the Fog - Yuri Norstein (1975).avi (121.82 megabyte)\n    * Le Papillon - Antoine Antin &amp; Jenny Rakotomamonjy (2002).avi (21.76 megabyte)\n    * Ryan Larkin - Street Musique.avi (115.64 megabyte)\n    * The End - Chris Landreth (1995).avi (51.41 megabyte)\n    * Tyger - Guilherme Marcondes ( 2006).avi (66.08 megabyte)\n    * Op Hop Hop Op - Pierre Hebert (1966).avi (33.89 megabyte)\n    * Icon for document filetype Comments.txt (19.36 kilobyte)\n    * Ivan Maximov - Bolero (1992).avi (101.19 megabyte)\n    * My Baby Just Cares For me - Aardman &amp; Nina Simone.avi (23.87 megabyte)\n    * Le Paysagiste (Mindscape) -Jacques Drouin (1976).avi (113 megabyte)\n    * Terry Gilliam - Storytime (1968).avi (84.98 megabyte)\n    * GÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©raldine - Arthur De Pins (2000).avi (114.73 megabyte)\n    * Jiri Trnka - Story Of The Bass Cello (1949).avi (124.16 megabyte)\n    * The Lump - John Weldon (1991).avi (128.48 megabyte)\n    * Emile Cohl - Fantasmagorie (1908).avi (3.22 megabyte)\n    * L'homme aux bras ballants - Laurent Gorgiard (1997).avi (103.09 megabyte)\n    * Alexander Petrov - The Old Man and the Sea (1999).avi (700.69 megabyte)\n    * Reci Reci Reci - Michaela Pavlatova (1991).avi (109.6 megabyte)\n    * Bambi meets Godzilla - Marv Newland (1969).avi (15.19 megabyte)\n\nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 11\n\nNearing the second aniversery of this online only festival, I decided to finally put another torrent online (two more are ready and will follow shortly). I included Will Vinton's Comedy Of Horrors, a Will Vinton Claymation production. Although maybe not as entertaining as Ward 13 (Part 1) and a bit overstocked on standard jokes, Will Vinton made a lot of claymation shorts and received a lot of recognition for them. However, he lost control of his studio in 2002 after Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, bought up the company and fired him. Former CEO's have a tendency of buying animation studio's: Steve Jobs bought Pixar in 1986, which back then primarily sold it's image computer power to the governments. Most of you have seen Luxo Jr, the short about a lamp and the reason the jumping lamp is still in the Pixar name: but maybe not many people have seen Luxo JR star in a Sesame Street short teaching young ones what is light, and what is heavy. Disney bought Pixar in 1991, and it's possibly the best move they made for the future succes of Disney animation. Their own stuff, as their oscar nominated Little Match Girl, just doesn't impress that much. Nowadays, more studio's try to follow in Pixar's footsteps: most notably, Blur Studio's, who have made what might be their best animation to date: a Gentleman's Duel. I don't know who came up with the Mech-warrior association to place fighting machines in this setting, but it's just perfect. Talking about weird associations: Priit Parn place this association game very well in Time Out, with a relaxed reggae tune on the background. One of the best shorts in this set is probably Strange Invaders, by Cordell Barker. Beautiful colors, great funny characters, perfect soundtrack. Piet Kroon deliviers a atmospheric animation with a strong classic storyline about a love triangle in 8 scenes, all animated by different animators (you might recognize Michael Dudok de Wit's drawing style on the boat. Satiemanie, by Zdenko Gasparovich was made in 1978 from a huge number of drawings, starts with walking studies, the a large number of woman studies, and jumps to a more cartoonesque part. I also included Peter and the Wolf, which very deservingly got nominated for an Oscar (but I'm guessing it's too early in Susan Templeton's career to win). I also included the making of, because some people requested it. As promised, the Tale of Tales (Nohrstein's best work) is featured in this edition as well. Enjoy, and please seed this torrent.

Guilherme Marcondes is included here as well (Remember him from Tyger in part 10?), and I can say he is one of my favorite modern day animators. Check out more of his work (among others the Modest Mouse video clip). The Saint Inspector is a nice claymation creation from the makers of The Secrets of Tom Thumb, which is not a short animation but still highly recommended. George Geertsen uses pencil drawings, some animated, some stills, combined with street noises to give us a look at a day in the park for an old man around 1971, in an animation produced by the much appreciated National Film Board of Canada. After Jumping (Part 8) I included a longer animation from Osama Tezuka, Legend of the Forest. Tezuka is still relatively unknown, although his work was hugely influential, especially on manga comics. Being influenced by Walt Disney (which is especially clear in Legend of The Forest), Walt Disney in turn plagiarized his television series Kimba The White Lion from the 60's in 1994 when they made The Lion King, without giving any credit to Tezuka. I recently read his comic series Buddha, and think Tezuka's greatest skill lies in approaching serious matters with a sense of humor. In Holding Your Breath, Anthony Lucas, you mainly see silhouettes, light backgrounds, and dark skinny shapes on the foreground, with the voice over contributing to the slightly tense atmosphere: it was nominated for a palm d?or in Cannes. Joanna Quinn has created the first reality series in animation with Dreams and Desires, Family Ties, as a typical British family is followed on a wedding day with a handheld camera. Naturally, everything goes horribly wrong, and it?s extremely funny, as the woman making the recordings? keeps commenting on what happens, while having a couple of drinks (and then some). In eternal gaze, Sam Chen takes Alberto Giacometti as his main subject, in a reasonably successful CGI film that won many festivals: personally, I feel it?s music is a bit too dramatic, and the movie is too long, but since it?s still well made, I included it here. In John Hubley?s The Hole, Hubley uses improvised dialogue from Dizzy Gillespie and George Mathews as two construction workers at work in the bottom of a hole on a construction site discussing the possibility of an accidental nuclear weapons attack. I also included a short by Yamamura (better known for his Oscar nominated Atama-yama), but I like this story much better. Some more experimental work comes from Oscar Fischinger (Spirals was his first film) and Robert Breer (70). \n\nContents of the Download:\n\nAnthony Lucas - Holding Your Breath (2001).avi\t80 MiB\nComments Part 12.txt\t22 KiB\nDreams and Desires - Family Ties (Joanna Quinn, 2006).avi\t150 MiB\nDusan Vukotic - Surogat (1961).avi\t72 MiB\nEternal Gaze - Sam Chen (2003).avi\t188 MiB\nGeorge Geertsen - The Men in the Park (1971).avi\t139 MiB\nGolovanova - Cat And Clown (1988).avi\t119 MiB\nGuilherme Marcondes - Into Pieces (2004).avi\t20 MiB\nJohn Hubley Faith Hubley - The Hole (1972).avi\t163 MiB\nKoji Yamamura - The Old Crocodile (2005).avi\t126 MiB\nLenny Bruce - Thank You Mask Man (1971).avi\t113 MiB\nLuis Cook - The Pearce Sisters (2007).avi\t131 MiB\nMark Baker - The Hill Farm (1989).avi\t349 MiB\nMichael Dudok de Wit - Tom Sweep.avi\t19 MiB\nMike Booth - The Saint Inspector (1996).avi\t65 MiB\nOsama Tezuka - Legend of the Forest (1987).avi\t319 MiB\nOskar Fischinger - Spirals (1926).avi\t37 MiB\nPaul Driessen - An Old Box.avi\t210 MiB\nRobert Breer - 70 (1970).avi\t53 MiB\nSilly Symphonies - The Old Mill (1937).avi\t96 MiB\nStan Brakhage - Water for Maya (2000).avi\t45 MiB\nWendy Tilby &amp; Amanda Forbis (1999) - When The Day Breaks.avi\t104 MiB\n\nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 13\n\n\n\nPuleng is a very short animation, made for Channel 4. Ali Taylor tells a simple story, with a strong atmosphere. The attention for the skin, and the combination of various styles work nicely. Nowy Janko Muzykant is a polish animation. The animation itself is quite static, made of paper cut-outs, but Lenica was one of the people to give Plish animation a boost. The tale of how is a a beautiful and rich animation about a as of yet unknown part of the history of the dodo. The story is told through an opera style voice over, with a richness that fits perfectly with the visuals. I think this work is a great example of modern animation, created in parttime. See the making of here: http://theblackheartgang.com/2007/12/18/the-making-of-the-tale-of-how-2007/. Intolerence III is without a doubt the great ending this trilogy deserves. It is touching, sharp, and funny, and often all at the same time. Since someone requested it, it's a pleasure to put it in this part. Munro is a funny short about getting drafted, from the perspective of a four year old. I especially like the difference between the dry voice of the narrator and the voice of Munro. It won an Oscar in 1961. Len Rye (not only a filmmaker, but also a poet, sculptor and innovative painter) created Free Radicals by scrathing on black film, and combined it with a sound-tape of African traditional music. It is seen as his masterpiece and influenced many animators since. Moo(n) by Leigh Hodgkinson is a story about a cow and a moon: the whole short is just as wittingly put together as the title, and it's an enjoyable experience altogether. Doonesbury is a animated short of the Doonesbury cartoon which was and is extremly popular ever since it started in 1970, made by Faith and John Hubley. Paul Driessen is featured here with one of his finest and funniest movies, Waterpeople, about people living half under the water (maybe inspired by his Dutch background). The music and soundeffects contribute a lot to the total atmosphere. Hasta Los Huesos comes from one of the major Mexican animators, Ren?? Castillo. Although Mexico might not be known for it's animation, this stop-motion with some beautiful camera work, telling the haunting story of a recently deceased man. Influenced by the typical Mexican tradition of Day of the Dead, this man refuses to accept his own death. Once in a while I like to add an exceptionally creative student film among these animations, this time it's Stephan-Flint M??ller's fliegenpflicht f??r quadrat k??pfe for using himself and everything in his surrounding to create an ongoing animation filled with very funny ideas topped with a good dosis of enthusiasm. I got a request to add something from Larry Jordan, and I think his moonlight sonata is a good example of his work, combining cut-outs with his own visual language of moving people, orbs (suns, ballons or any circels) over classical music, on a background of 17th century paintings. Jeffrey Scher's trigger happy is a short shot on a lightbox with hig-contrast film, and is made up of objects found on the streets in New York. Talking about the benefits of recycling ;). The happy soundtrack is by Shay Lynch. Madame Tutli-Putli did well during the last Oscars, and is beautifully made. Liam Kemp's the Wonderful Life tries to bring you the most lifelike 3D graphics of people, and they do a really nice job. The storyline is a bit sad, perhaps, and could do better, but I included it because visually it's stunning, even though it's already some years old. Even older is Fischinger's Allegretto, a colorful feast that would almost have been know to us only in black and white when paramount wanted to change it to fit in with a feature film. Fischinger refused and eventually bought back the rights. I'd like to thank CinemaGrotesque for providing a lot of great independent cinema, some of which is futured in these torrents. In addition, thanks to all of those who continue to share these torrents. Finally, I want to dedicate this torrent to all animations students: may you be inspired to create beautiful animations yourself!\t\t\n\n\n\nAllegretto - Oskar Fischinger (1936).avi\t29 MiB\nChristopher Hinton - Nibbles (2003).avi\t57 MiB\nComments.txt\t4 KiB\nDown to the Bone (Hasta los huesos) - Rene Castillo (2001).avi\t85 MiB\nGene Deitch - Munro (1961).avi\t58 MiB\nJan Lenica - Nowy Janko Muzykant (1960).avi\t107 MiB\nJeff Scher - Trigger Happy (1997).avi\t39 MiB\nJohn &amp; Faith Hubley - Doonesbury (1977).avi\t299 MiB\nLarry Jordan - Moonlight Sonata (1979).avi\t80 MiB\nLeigh Hodgkinson - Moo(n) (2004).avi\t36 MiB\nLen Rye - Free Radicals (1958).avi\t46 MiB\nMadame Tutli-Putli (2007).avi\t204 MiB\nPanique au Village - Stephane Aubier &amp; Vincent Patar (2000).avi\t29 MiB\nPaul Driessen - Le Peuple De L'eau (1992).avi\t160 MiB\nPhil Mulloy - Intolerance III.avi\t229 MiB\nPuleng - Ali Taylor.avi\t47 MiB\nStephan-Flint MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller - Fliegenpflicht FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r Quadrat KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶pfe (2004).avi\t266 MiB\nTale of How - The Blackheart Gang (2005).avi\t87 MiB\nThis wonderful life - Liam Kemp (2003).avi\t319 MiB\n\nBeltesassar's Short Animation Festival Part 14\n\nI included a Flash animation for the first time. It's a great new medium to create animations in, and this animation of John Coltrane's Giant Steps by Levy is extremely well done. From the very funny stop motion filmmaker PES I added Game Over. For more PES animation, check out www.eatpes.com. Don Hertzfeldt has created a new short where he combines his traditional pencil drawings with  experimental photography to tell the story about how the simple things in life can start to become quite scary. Guide Dog is Plympton's follow up to the short Guard Dog, who's that this isn't the career for the dog as well. Thankfully it's followed by Hot Dog, so there's hope for poor creature. I Met The Walrus by Josh Raskin is an animation made over an interview of John Lennon. It's well done, although it does not exceed being more than a visual description of what's being discussed. Anyway, I'm a Lennon fan, and if you are as well, it is enjoyable. Superflat Monogram by Takeshi Murakami is a visual bombardment of colors. A young girl floats through an Alice in Wonderland like world. The soundtrack Different Colors by Fantastic Plastic Machine fits the commercial, which was made for Louis Vuitton, perfectly. Wallace and Grommit's a Close Shave is a classic, and this is the best Wallace and Grommit short. Shaun the Sheep has gotten is own show recently, but this is his first acting performence. Tuk Tuk is a funny shot by one of the best Russian animators, Konstantin Bronzit. I got a request for something from Michel Ocelot, and added the first tale of his movie Princes et Princesses. It's not a short animation really, but the seperate tales can be watched seperately, and it's beautifully made, and the story is excellent. Big Buck Bunny by Sacha Goedegebure recently won the audience award at the Holland Animation Film Festival. It deserves a lot of credit for being an open source movie. Regina Pessoa has creates a truly original short animation (Tragic Story with a Happy Ending) but pencil drawings and a haunting story about a girl whose heart beats very loudly. By the Gobelins L'ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°cole de L'Image comes the funny short Oktopodi which has been received very well in festivals the last 2 years. I hope you will enjoy these and the other short in this part.\n\n          * Alexander Petrov - My Love (2006).avi (220.29 megabyte)\n          * Anthony Lawrence - Looking for Horses (2001).avi (67.54 megabyte)\n          * Bill Plympton - Guide Dog (2006).avi (45.44 megabyte)\n          * Icon for document filetype Comments Part 14.txt (2.22 kilobyte)\n          * Don Hertzfeldt - Everything will be ok (2006).avi (145.19 megabyte)\n          * Florence Henrard - Sortie de bain (1994).avi (120.11 megabyte)\n          * Gobelins - Oktapodi (2007).avi (84.68 megabyte)\n          * Jeff Scher - Milk of Amnesia (1992).avi (115.73 megabyte)\n          * John Raskin - I Met The Walrus (2007).avi (99.16 megabyte)\n          * Juan Pablo Zaramella - Sexteens (2006).avi (33.66 megabyte)\n          * Kevin Deters - How to Hook Up Your Home Theater (2007).avi (75.49 megabyte)\n          * Konstantin Bronzit - Tuk-tuk (1993).avi (40.12 megabyte)\n          * Larry Jordan - Our Lady of the Sphere (1972).avi (233.01 megabyte)\n          * Icon for unknown filetype Michal Levy - Giant Steps (2001).swf (4.62 megabyte)\n          * Nick Park - Wallace and Gromit - A Close Shave (1995).avi (350.01 megabyte)\n          * Ochelot - Princes et Princesses (2000).avi (71.96 megabyte)\n          * Paul Grimault - Les passagers de La Grande Ourse (1943).avi (168.41 megabyte)\n          * PES - Game Over.avi (34.99 megabyte)\n          * Philip Hunt - Ah Pook Is Here (1994).avi (48.66 megabyte)\n          * Presto - Pixar (2008).avi (73.83 megabyte)\n          * Regina Pessoa (2006) - Histoire Tragique Avec Fin Heureuse.avi (69.68 megabyte)\n          * Ruth Lingford - Death and the Mother (1997).avi (165.27 megabyte)\n          * Sacha Goedegebure - Big Buck Bunny (2008).avi (271.26 megabyte)\n          * Sientje - Christa Moesker (1997).avi (74.58 megabyte)\n          * Superflat Monogram - Takashi Murakami.avi (57.97 megabyte)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d74daf7fe856c5afcc584cca19d1f515e7b6c01","amp;dn":"Beltesassar+Short+Animation+Festival+Part+15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d74daf7fe856c5afcc584cca19d1f515e7b6c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,116,218,247,254,133,108,90,252,197,132,204,161,157,31,81,94,123,108,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
