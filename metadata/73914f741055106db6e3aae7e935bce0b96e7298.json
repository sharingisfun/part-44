Here in the richest country on earth, 50 million of us Ã¢â‚¬â€ one in six Americans Ã¢â‚¬â€ go hungry. More than a third of them are children. And yet Congress canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pass a Farm Bill because our representatives continue to fight over how many billions to slash from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. The debate is filled with tired clichÃƒÂ©s about freeloaders undeserving of government help, living large at the expense of honest, hardworking taxpayers. But a new documentary, A Place at the Table, paints a truer picture of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poor.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The cost of food insecurity, obesity and malnutrition is way larger than it is to feed kids nutritious food,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kristi Jacobson, one of the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s directors and producers, tells Bill. She and Mariana Chilton, director of the Center for Hunger-Free Communities, explain to Bill how hunger hits hard at people from every walk of life.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no opportunity for people who are low-income to really engage in our democracy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Chilton. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re actively shut out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLater, Greg Kaufmann Ã¢â‚¬â€ poverty correspondent for The Nation Ã¢â‚¬â€ talks about how the poor have been stereotyped and demonized in an effort to justify huge cuts in food stamps and other crucial programs for low-income Americans.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“People are working and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not getting paid enough to feed their families, pay their utilities, pay for their housing, pay for the healthcareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not paying people enough to pay for the basics, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to need help getting food,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kaufmann tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are a lot of corporations that want to be involved in the fight against hunger. The best thing they can do is get on board for fair wages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73914f741055106db6e3aae7e935bce0b96e7298","amp;dn":"The+Faces+of+America%26rsquo%3Bs+Hungry-PBS+Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company-062","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73914f741055106db6e3aae7e935bce0b96e7298","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,145,79,116,16,85,16,109,182,227,170,231,233,53,188,224,185,110,114,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
