All In is a pop-punk record that is both upbeat and heartfelt, showcasing new depth and growth both lyrically and musically while maintaining the fun that has characterized the band since it's first release in 2003. Says lead singer/guitarist Adam Agee, &quot;So much of this album is about not wasting the time we've been given. I hope these songs are anthems for people to live that out.&quot;\n\n Track Listing\t \n01. Criminals and Kings\t\n02. All In (Apologize)\t\n03. My Surrender\t\n04. Never Left Your Side\t\n05.
