Their activism becomes interwoven with their art. The Indigo Girls have long been known for voicing their political and social views in song. Amy Ray teamed up with Emily Saliers while in high school, and soon the duo became a staple in the Atlanta music scene. In 1981, their independent music career began with a basement recording called Tuesday's Children. One thing led to another, and they signed with Epic Records in 1988. Despite almost polar-opposite styles, they met on the common ground of harmony and the love of meaningful music. Ray brought fire and earth, Saliers the wind and water. The alchemy proved magical, and their brand of folk-rock hit at just the right time alongside the successes of Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega, and 10,000 Maniacs. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tDaemon Records\nCatalog:\t\t19059\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Hunter's Prayer\n02.Oyster And Pearl\n03.The Gig That Matters\n04.Time Zone\n05.Anyhow\n06.Duane Allman\n07.More Pills\n08.Broken Record\n09.Goodnight Tender\n10.My Dog\n11.Let The Spirit\n12.When You Come For Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ed84d76bd8ddbc3004dfc7fa340a5b40fa6c701","amp;dn":"Amy+Ray+-+Goodnight+Tender+%282014%29+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ed84d76bd8ddbc3004dfc7fa340a5b40fa6c701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,216,77,118,189,141,219,195,0,77,252,127,163,64,165,180,15,166,199,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
