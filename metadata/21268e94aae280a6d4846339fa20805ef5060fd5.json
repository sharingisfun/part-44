This book describes taxonomy of changes that are expected in semantic service oriented environments. The process of change management consists of detecting, propagating, and reacting to changes.\n\nChange Management for Semantic Web Services is one of the first books that discuss the development of a theoretical foundation for managing changes in atomic and long-term composed services. This book also proposes a formal model and a change language to provide sufficient semantics for change management; it devises an automatic process to react to, verify, and optimize changes. Case studies and examples are presented in the last section of this book.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 210 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (April 6, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1441993282\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1441993281","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21268e94aae280a6d4846339fa20805ef5060fd5","amp;dn":"Change+Management+for+Semantic+Web+Services%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21268e94aae280a6d4846339fa20805ef5060fd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,38,142,148,170,226,128,166,212,132,99,57,250,32,128,94,245,6,15,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
