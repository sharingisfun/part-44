Vitamin's take on the debut album &quot;De-loused in the Comatorium&quot;) from the Mars Volta; I ALSO FINALLY FOUND string versions of the EP preceding it (&quot;Tremulant&quot;), SO HAVE NOW ADDED THEM, MAKING THIS AN UPDATE OF MY PREVIOUS TORRENT.\nIn any case some nice listening when you need to take a break from the sonic adrenalin that is the Mars Volta :) Or even to put on something that even your mom will think is cool (which actually did happen to me).\n\nMP3s\n\n1. &quot;Son et LumiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re\n2. &quot;Inertiatic ESP&quot;   \n3. &quot;Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)&quot;  \n4. &quot;Tira Me a las AraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±as&quot;  \n5. &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot;   \n6. &quot;Eriatarka&quot;  \n7. &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot;  \n8. &quot;This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed&quot;   \n9. &quot;Televators&quot;   \n10. &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot;   \n\n\n\n*******\nI JUST ADDED THESE THREE FROM THE &quot;TREMULANT&quot; EP (DEC. 22, 2010)!!!!\n11. &quot;Cut That City&quot;   \n12. &quot;Concertina&quot;   \n13. &quot;Eunuch Provocateur&quot;   \n*******\n\n\nAnd, as I always say, but especially for anything related to the greatest band in existence, support your musicians. TMV is definitely worth it. Buy their albums and definitely see their live shows, which are amazing (not to mention a much better way to support the artists directly as opposed to the record companies).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a025b5310a042edd760b4fc27d69558365a836","amp;dn":"The+String+Quartet+Tribute+to+the+Mars+Volta%3A+SQT+ESP+%28%2B+Tremula","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a025b5310a042edd760b4fc27d69558365a836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,160,37,181,49,10,4,46,221,118,11,79,194,125,105,85,131,101,168,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
