So many great tracks were released in the last 2 months it's not even funny! Of course, I couldn't fit them all into one mix. But I tried. (So much so that some of the mixes are a little crowded. My apologies.)\n\nThe mix is called &quot;Magnet&quot;. Don't ask.\n\n\nIf you're into vocal progressive house, you'll love Nobody Seems To Care by 16 Bit Lolitas and Shik Stylko's Many Dayz in the beginning. The middle is a little more techy starting with Gregor Tresher's amazing track Awaking Life Inside and ending with King Roc's A Pocket Full of Prose. Then, a little bit of the Underworld sound with Downpipe can't hurt. Quivver's RustleDust is a heavenly track, and don't miss Josh Gabriel's and Dave Seaman's monstrous Heyaah, too. There are also some classics: most notably PQM's You Are Sleeping and RidgewalkersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œ Find feat. El.\n\nIf you like what you hear, become a friend/fan of me on Facebook.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n16 Bit Lolitas -- Nobody Seems To Care (Original)\nShik Stylko -- Many Dayz (Tom Novy &amp; Jerome IsmaAe Remix)\nPQM -- You Are Sleeping (PMQ Meets Luke Chable Vocal Pass)\nPaul Keeley -- Doormatica (Original)\nGregor Tresher -- Awaking Life Inside (Original)\nPhunk Investigation -- Black Tamurra (Egostereo Remix)\nKing Roc -- A Pocket Full Of Prose (D-Nox &amp; Beckers Remix)\nUnderworld &amp; D-Ramirez &amp; Mark Knight -- Downpipe (Original Club Mix)\nJaytech -- Sundance (Original)\nQuivver -- RustleDust (Original)\nRidgewalkers -- Find feat El (Andy Moor Mix)\nJosh Gabriel &amp; Dave Seaman -- Heyaah (Original)\n16 Bit Lolitas -- Murder Weapon (Original)\n\nThis mix was recorded with 2 CDJs and a crappy Behringer mixer.\n\n\n##############\n\nGet more free mixes at http://www.philipage.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21be0acf20ccc3fa77b95a88c2d2a830b6ec88a8","amp;dn":"Philip+Age+--+Magnet+%28November+2009+Progressive+House+Mix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21be0acf20ccc3fa77b95a88c2d2a830b6ec88a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,190,10,207,32,204,195,250,119,185,90,136,194,210,168,48,182,236,136,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
