In Secrets to the Grave, a killing is solved with the aid of the new science of criminal profiling.\nDown the Darkest Road offers no spate of new murders and no new science. Instead, the story focuses on Laura and Leah Lawton, the suffering they share, and LauraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quest for justice.\n\nLauraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sixteen-year-old daughter, Leslie, was kidnapped. Laura knows who did it, but the police had no evidence for an arrest. Two years later, in 1988, her husband committed suicide, and Laura and her younger daughter Leah were left alone to cope.\nLaura knows that the kidnapper, Roland Ballencoa, lives in Oak Knoll, and she has spent four fruitless years trying to get the police to arrest him. Laura refuses to give up, however, and her obsessive quest for justice blinds her to her younger daughterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suffering. At a time when they should be grieving and healing together, Leslie and Laura suffer separately. The pain never lessens, and they dream and cry alone.\n\nThrough the chilling case at the heart of Down the Darkest Road, Hoag hooks ever more readers into the meticulously crafted, all-too-terrifying world of Oak Knoll, where the scariest secrets of all can be found . . . Down the Darkest Road.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead by Read by Kirsten Potter.\n\n----------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobookvault.ws&lt;/a&gt;\n----------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370258ac36269c16339011234b5a70fae68d76e4","amp;dn":"Down+The+Darkest+Road+by+Tami+Hoag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370258ac36269c16339011234b5a70fae68d76e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,2,88,172,54,38,156,22,51,144,17,35,75,90,112,250,230,141,118,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
