Moreover, IObit states on the product's website that IObit Malware Fighter is &quot;The World's Leading Anti-Malware Tool&quot; with capabilities such as &quot;detect and remove infections and hidden threats&quot; as well as &quot;fully compatible with all Anti-Virus products&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd these to an already astounding presentation of the software and the average user may rapidly think they stumbled upon the greatest Anti-Malware solution of all-time. But then, how can a company that was tried the same thing in the past with IObit Security 360 and failed miserably due to constant bad publicity involving various database theft allegations from Malwarebytes can produce such a God-like-program?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI won't dig up skeletons of the past application here, thus I must redirect my attention on the protagonist of this particular review and if IObit Malware Fighter is, indeed, tghe application we should all use, then all will serely be forgiven and forgotten, As\t there is no time and space left to discuss about what happened to it's predecessor, but praise and kneel before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough with the sarcasm, allthough it is based on actual facts that prove the inability of IObit Malware Fighter to rise above all and reigh over the other Anti-Malware solution developers. First stop: the installation process. Even though it is fairly exusable for other type of software to offer any kind of adware whitin their free edition installers, such behavior in Anti-Malware software is propostuos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIObit Malware Fighter's interface is quite the looker and that can and may be the only thing it's good at. As tests suggest, the previous statement is utterly terue and one miore thing IObit Malware Fighter is really good at is beating any of it's rivals to the bottom of any test chart both in malware blocking and malware removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis peculiar piece of software does not add any kind of proactive protection such as browser plugins to block malware-containg websites from the get-go as well as malicious hosted files as soon as the download process starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile genuine Anti-Malware solutions detect harmful code long before it is actually launched, IObit Malware Fighter utilizes the Pesky-Method of triggering scans when applications start and not before. What's ever worse is that it fails to detect malware and a whole lot of it as it finds it's way into your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse-positives are yest another problem with IObit Malware Fighter. In few cases and in small numbers, fase-positives are not a bothering things, but with IObit Malware Fighter, they have a place of their own. Maybe that's the way of this program to deal with all the malware it misses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBad thoughts aside, IObit Malware Fighter is, indeed, &quot;The World's Leading Anti-Malware Tool&quot; in theory, more precisely, in IObit's theory. In the real world, where thorough tests are conducted and pitful applications are discovered, IObit Malware Fighter is yet another one that fail to provide. Maybe, just mabey, it has something to do with the absence of the supposedly not stolen Malwarebytes database, as IObit claimed, that also triggered the fall of it's predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\n \nhttp://imgbay.mobi/di/IObitMFLicense-abskj.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c505d44890bace7af980d2a87607fe732bbd4e1","amp;dn":"IObit+Malware+Fighter+Pro+4.0.3.20+%2B+Patch+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c505d44890bace7af980d2a87607fe732bbd4e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,80,93,68,137,11,172,231,175,152,13,42,135,96,127,231,50,187,212,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
