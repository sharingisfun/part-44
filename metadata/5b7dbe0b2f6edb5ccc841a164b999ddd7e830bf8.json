I'll Remember You\n\nRecorded between 1966 and 1968.\n \nThe history books say that in 1968, the King had made a major comeback, singing good and great songs with a newfound conviction in a Memphis setting. Yet before that, in 1966 and 1967, Elvis had recorded some sessions in Nashville that heralded his mighty return--yet nobody knew it, for the songs were all scattered over albums both great and lousy. TOMORROW IS A LONG TIME collects them, and this compilation stands as one of the best in Presley\\\\\\'s massive catalog. From the nervy, scintillating take on Chuck Berry\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Too Much Monkey Business,\\\\\\&quot; to the salacious celebration of carnality that is \\\\\\&quot;Down in the Alley,\\\\\\&quot; to the sublime, beautiful love song \\\\\\&quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time\\\\\\&quot; (its writer, Bob Dylan, said it was his favorite cover version of one of his songs), Presley sings with a sensitivity and passion that recalls his mid-\\\\\\'50s recordings.\nAll tracks have been digitally remastered.\nCompilation producers: Ernst Mikael Jorgensen, Roger Semon.\nEngineers: James Malloy, Al Pachucki, Bill Vandervort.\nPersonnel: Dolores Edgin, June Page, The Imperials, The Jordanaires, Millie Kirkham (vocals); Charlie McCoy (guitar, harmonica, organ); Chip Young, Harold Bradley, Jerry Reed, Scotty Moore (guitar); Pete Drake (steel guitar); Homer Randolph, Rufus Long, Boots Randolph (saxophone); Ray Stevens (trumpet); David Briggs , Floyd Cramer (piano, organ); Henry Slaughter, Hoyt Hawkins (organ); D.J.
