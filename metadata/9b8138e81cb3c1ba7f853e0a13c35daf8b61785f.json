The music selected for the soundtrack set out to reflect precisely that setting.\r\nThe film makers approached TANGATA RECORDS to assist in piecing together a soundtrack which accurately reflected contemporary Maori and the indigenous culture of Aotearoa (NZ).\r\nThe 'KARANGA' (A call to ancestors) opens the album, and immediately demonstrates the unique nature of this soundtrack. The 'PUREREHUA' (a Bull Roarer type of instrument) can be heard 'whirring' in the opening bars of TAMA RENATA's rock instrumental theme song 'Warrior', with the Hendrix like guitar and the 'HÎ‘ÎšÎ‘' warrior vocal chant creating a dynamic blend of traditional and contemporary feels. Traditional wind instruments called KOAUAU (on the 'Sunrise flutes' and 'Screaming flutes' tracks are performed by HIRINI MELBOURNE. Hirini also plays other traditional instruments on the album and is heard performing a 'PAATEREâ€™ (vocal chant).\r\nTE REO MAORI (The Maori language) is an important element in this album, and is used beautifully in bonus tracks by MOANA AND THE MOAHUNTERS, MAREE SHEEHAN and E TU.\r\nHip Hop and Ragga music have made a real impact in urban New Zealand, with UPPER HUTT POSSE's catchy 'Ragga Girl' and GIFTED AND BROWN's 'So Much Soul'. The antipodean flavoured reggae of HERBS, SOUTHSIDE OF BOMBAY and SURVIVAL's songs are indicative of the reggae influence. MERENIA and ARDIJAH introduce a seductive and soulful groove to the album.\r\nFilm score instrumental segments which feature throughout the album were written by the films music producers, MURRAY GRINDLAY and MURRAY McNABB. Lead actors TEMUERA MORRISON and RENA OWEN switch to singers for their love theme 'Here Is My Heart'.\r\nTangata Records thank Robin Scholes and Lee Tamahori for their belief in waiata Maori. Special thanks go out to all the musicians, artists, actors, crew and people associated with this inspiring film.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Unknown Artist - Karanga    [0:14]\r\n02.
