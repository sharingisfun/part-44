It's a primal, sickening howl from the depths of Layne Staley's heroin addiction, and one of the most harrowing concept albums ever recorded. Not every song on Dirt is explicitly about heroin, but Jerry Cantrell's solo-written contributions (nearly half the album) effectively maintain the thematic coherence -- nearly every song is imbued with the morbidity, self-disgust, and/or resignation of a self-aware yet powerless addict. Cantrell's technically limited but inventive guitar work is by turns explosive, textured, and queasily disorienting, keeping the listener off balance with atonal riffs and off-kilter time signatures. \n\n \n Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic, \n HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality \n of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is! \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Them bones [02:30] \n 02.Dam that river [03:09] \n 03.Rain when I die [06:02] \n 04.Down in A hole [05:38] \n 05.Sickman [05:30] \n 06.Rooster [06:15] \n 07.Junkhead [05:09] \n 08.Dirt [05:16] \n 09.Godsmack [03:51] \n 10.Untitled [00:44] \n 11.Hate to feel [05:16] \n 12.Angry chair [04:48] \n 13.Would [03:28] \n ____ \n \n 57:36 min \n 88,7 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0681edd44631f3096e2d361a0cd747ea36139db","amp;dn":"Alice_In_Chains-Dirt-%28Retail%29-1992-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0681edd44631f3096e2d361a0cd747ea36139db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,104,30,221,68,99,31,48,150,226,211,97,160,205,116,126,163,97,57,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
