Thanks to our supplier &quot;you rock our\nsocks and liberate their software :-)&quot;\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re doing anything technical, think Mathematica - not just for\ncomputation, but for modeling, simulation, visualization, development,\ndocumentation, and deployment.\n\nWhy Mathematica? Because this one integrated system delivers unprecedented\nworkflow, coherence, reliability, and innovation.\n\nRather than different toolkits for different jobs, Mathematica has been\nbuilt ground-up over nearly 20 years to deliver one vision: the ultimate\ntechnical application and environment.\n\nFollowing closely on the dramatic reinvention of Mathematica in 2007,\nMathematica 7 continues the momentum of innovation to deliver an array\nof new capabilities, greatly extending the state of the art in many areas,\nand bringing a dozen major new application fields into the integrated\nframework of Mathematica.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Unrar, Burn or mount the image.\n\n2. Install Mathematica 7.0\n\n3. Use the keygen in the EDGE dir to license your copy.\n\nNote: keygen supplied as windows exe only, sorry we are just\ngenerally lazy ... generate your lic on a winbox.\n\n4. Enjoy!\n\nWE ARE DEDICATED TO QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, AND DOING IT FOR THE LULZ!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:246da44f114c9f115d94175486e33fc54f27b349","amp;dn":"WOLFRAM.RESEARCH.MATHEMATICA.V7.0.LINUX-EDGEISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"246da44f114c9f115d94175486e33fc54f27b349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,109,164,79,17,76,159,17,93,148,23,84,134,227,63,197,79,39,179,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
