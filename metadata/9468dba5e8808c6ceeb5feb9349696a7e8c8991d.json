The book is a rollicking reference guide to the most essential areas of knowledge in ProopsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s universe, from the noteworthy names of the ancient world and baseball, to the movies you must see and the albums you must hear.\n\nComplete with historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s juiciest tales and curious back-stories, Proops expounds on the merits of poetry and proper punctuation, delivering this wealth of information with his signature style and Proopsian panache. An off-beat and exuberant guide to everything, The Smartest Book in the World gives you everything you need to know to always be the smartest person in the room.
