Through a series of task-oriented, hands-on procedures, this book will showcase each of the techniques available in Flash for creating character animations and displaying characters against dynamic backgrounds. Tweening, shape and color morphing, frame-by-frame animation, panning and zooming, sound synchronization, and other processes will be covered and explained through examples.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLee Purcell is the director of Lightspeed Publishing LLC, a Vermont-based company that specializes in electronic publishing tools and techniques and provides technical communication for a wide variety of clients. As the author of eight books on emerging technologiesÃ¢â‚¬â€ranging from Internet audio to recordable CD and DVDÃ¢â‚¬â€he primarily focuses his writing efforts on helping developers and users effectively take advantage of the most promising hardware and software tools in the electronic publishing field.\n\nPurcell also writes the quarterly newsletter, CD-ROM Access, for Disc Makers, the largest independent disc replication service in the United States. In the course of authoring trade computer titles and producing articles on CD-ROM development, he routinely interviews many of the prominent designers, developers, inventors, and luminaries involved in the computer industry and rich media production, and he has earned a reputation for distilling difficult technical topics into clear, concise descriptions, so that they are accessible for readers with different levels of experience.\n\nWhen not wrestling with beta software releases from computer companies, Purcell plays electric jazz bass, traverses the back roads of Vermont on a Ducati Monster, and works on completing a novel that has been slowly unfolding for the last 11 years. The novel, a ghost story set in and around Cape Ann, Massachusetts, is told from the point of view of the ghosts. He hopes to have it finished within the next year.\n\nFor additional information, point your browser to http://www.lightspeedpub.com.\n\nInternational Standard Book Number: 0-672-32199-8\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number: 2001087200\nPrinted in the United States of America\nFirst Printing: August 2001\n04 03 02 01 4 3 2 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d456aaf27488397bb28cdcf571d4f500610b8059","amp;dn":"%5BLee_Purcell%5DFlash+Character+Animation+Applied+Studio+Techniques","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d456aaf27488397bb28cdcf571d4f500610b8059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,86,170,242,116,136,57,123,178,140,220,245,113,212,245,0,97,11,128,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
