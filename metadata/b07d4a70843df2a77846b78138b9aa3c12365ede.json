The essence of his idea combines articulation of the locomotive and compound steam use. The articulation was achieved by supporting the front of the locomotive on a bogie frame (called a Bissell truck); the compound steam system fed steam at boiler pressure to high pressure cylinders for the main driving wheels. As the steam was exhausted from those cylinders, it was passed into a low pressure receiver and was then sent to low pressure cylinders to power the driving wheels on the Bissell truck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b07d4a70843df2a77846b78138b9aa3c12365ede","amp;dn":"The+Mallet+Locomotive+%28Train+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b07d4a70843df2a77846b78138b9aa3c12365ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,125,74,112,132,61,242,167,120,70,183,129,56,185,170,60,18,54,94,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
