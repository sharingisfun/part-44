Andrew Clarke, Paul Hogan (in his first dramatic role), Tony Bonner, Jon Blake, Megan Williams, Ilona Rogers and Robert Coleby among many others.\n\n\nThe battle scenes are terrific and the muddy trenches of the Western Front look acceptably cold and horrible.\n\nSome of the acting goes a bit astray and there is sometimes a bit too much play on larrikinism and Ockerness, but overall it sits well as a quality drama with good characters.\n\nI say this only because I really rated ANZACs highly when I originally saw it on the box, but since then TV perfection in the shape of Band of Brothers has come along and blown almost everything else out of the water.\n\nThe DVD transfer for ANZACs is pretty good, considering its age, although it does suffer a little from graininess (not in itself a bad thing for a gritty period piece) and it lacks sharpness and contrast.\n\nStill, it is a good yarn and one Australians should take the time to watch.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088479/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEpisode 3: The Somme Winter (1916-17)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The Hindenberg LineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ BullecourtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Blighty LeaveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Third Battle of Ypres begins (July 1917)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Menin RoadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Broodseinde RidgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\n\n\n\n\nFile size : 1.09 GB\nFormat : Audio Video Interleave\nPlayTime : 1h 37mn\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD\nFamily : MPEG-4\nInfo : XviD project\nCodec settings : BVOP\nWidth : 672\nHeight : 512\nAspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate : 25 fps\n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily : MPEG-1\nCodec profile : Joint stereo\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nBit rate mode : CBR\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\nResolution : 16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f85d3fb63b17a8ca65b0c70ee7f6b38f9fa1245","amp;dn":"ANZACs-Australian+TV+Miniseries+%281985%29+Episode+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f85d3fb63b17a8ca65b0c70ee7f6b38f9fa1245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,133,211,251,99,177,122,140,166,91,12,112,238,127,107,56,249,250,18,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
