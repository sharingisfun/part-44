A dedicated scientist who is obsessed with his work and neglects his emotional life until it's almost too late. A misunderstood alien visitor. A clash between high ideals of scholarship and the more venal concerns of commerce and greed. There are some minor differences between this pilot and later episodes, most notably a slightly longer title sequence which merges into the first scene of the story. But the strengths of the series are self-evident: intelligent writing, a well-realised alien creature and a terrific film noir look to it all, lots of stark shadows and a hard cold look to the picture. Cliff Robertson is ideal as the man reaching out to the stars, but missing the importance of people around him. A great template for the series. \n\nKeep this seed alive.............\n\n\nwww.fatfuckfrank.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ba4d32634979220e2c3c5bf2e7548251d723d39","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits-+The+Galaxy+Being+%28S01E01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ba4d32634979220e2c3c5bf2e7548251d723d39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,164,211,38,52,151,146,32,226,195,197,191,46,117,72,37,29,114,61,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
