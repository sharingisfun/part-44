Spyware Doctor is a multi-award winning spyware removal utility that detects, removes and protects your PC from thousands of potential spyware, adware, Trojans, keyloggers, spybots and tracking threats. Protect your privacy and computing habits from prying eyes and virtual trespassers with the help of Spyware Doctor.\nAnti-virus software and firewalls do not fully protect your system against the majority of spyware and privacy threats. Because spyware is commonly bundled with software downloads, attached to e-mails, or transmitted through networks it can appear to be legitimate software, but once installed it can be nearly impossible to detect and remove without the help of a dedicated spyware removal tool like Spyware Doctor.\n\nSpyware Doctor is advanced technology designed especially for people, not just experts. That is one reason why it won the People&amp;#039;s Choice Award in 2005, 2006 and 2007. It is automatically configured out of the box to give you optimal protection with limited interaction so all you need to do is install it for immediate and ongoing protection.\n\nSpyware Doctor&amp;#039;s advanced OnGuard technology only alerts users on a true Spyware detection. This is significant because you should not be interrupted by cryptic questions every time you install software, add a site to your favorites or change your PC settings. Such messages can be confusing and lead to undesirable outcomes such as inoperable programs, lost favorites or even Spyware being allowed to install on the system. We&amp;#039;ve done the research so you don&amp;#039;t have to.\n\nSpyware Doctor Tools:\n- Spyware &amp; Adware Scanner Keylogger\n- Guard Popup\n- Blocker Phishing\n- Protector Real Time\n- Protection Browser\n- Guard Spyware Cookie\n- Guard Malware\n- Immunizer\n\nSpyware Doctor Key Features:\nComprehensive Malware Protection\nSpyware Doctor provides protection against identity theft, stealthy spyware, aggressive adware, browser hijackers, malicious ActiveX objects, malware Trojans, tracking cookies, keyloggers, dialers, and other malware. The optional anti-virus module also protects your computer from viruses, worms, Trojan horse threats, and other malicious infections.\nConstant Real-time Protection\nThrough its unique OnGuard feature Spyware Doctor provides constant protection against malware. OnGuard works by blocking both known and unknown malware threats before they can install and cause any harm to a computer. OnGuard constantly monitors for malicious behavior involving spyware processes, tracking cookies, malicious ActiveX objects, browser hijackers, keyloggers, Trojans and more.\nAdvanced Detection and Removal Technology\n- By running an Intelli-Scan, Full Scan or Custom Scan, Spyware Doctor will inspect the computer for all types of spyware and virus1 infections. Spyware Doctor is top rated by industry experts as being extremely effective in removing particularly nefarious threats such as rootkits and keyloggers2.\n- The unique Intelli-Scan feature is specifically designed to hunt swiftly and kill active running spyware threats in as little as 3 minutes3, attributed to the intuitive and patent-pending spider scanning technology. This new technology works intelligently by using a combination of signature and behavioral scanning techniques to quickly and effectively identify internet threats.\nProtection against zero-day threats - Behavioral Heuristic Detection\nSpyware Doctor delivers effective zero day protection against rootkits and keyloggers (in both scanning and OnGuard real-time areas) by monitoring for suspicious behavior and blocking applications that exhibit signs of malicious activity.\nAdvanced Rootkit Detection\nSpyware Doctor is capable of detecting and removing hidden processes and files associated with complex threats and rootkits. Using behavioral techniques, rootkits and other items that attempt to hide themselves deep in the computer operating system are effectively detected and removed.\nWorks silently in the background with low CPU usage\nWhen in monitoring mode Spyware Doctor has been designed to work silently in the background, with little impact to the end user, threats are blocked and removed without any system impact, while only a small alert window is displayed to advise the user it has been protected against an attack. When running a scan, the CPU Priority settings allow users to lower the priority of the scanning in order to reduce CPU usage and impact to the computer while in use. Selecting this option may increase scan time but will ease CPU usage when other applications are running at the same time.\nAutomatic and silent Smart Updates\nFrequent updates to detect and guard computers against new threats and viruses as well as provide enhancements to Spyware Doctor are automatically installed and downloaded through the Smart Update function. Threat signatures are updated every business day or within hours of a high risk malware outbreak to protect you from the latest online threats.\nMost internationally awarded anti-spyware product\nSpyware Doctor is consistently awarded editors choice and top rating by numerous internationally recognized and respected industry publications, making Spyware Doctor the most internationally awarded anti-spyware product.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9400c689475ba3324c267473a808eb917f157baa","amp;dn":"Spyware+Doctor+6.0.0.354%28with+crack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9400c689475ba3324c267473a808eb917f157baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,0,198,137,71,91,163,50,76,38,116,115,168,8,235,145,127,21,123,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
