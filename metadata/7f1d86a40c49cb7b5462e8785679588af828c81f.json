In Ayurveda, David Simon has found a system based on individuality--on our unique responses to food, exercise, stress, medicine, surgery, and a wide range of external factors. By using the mind body questionnaire that begins on page 51 of The Wisdom of Healing, you can establish your own mind body type and find a daily routine that is ideally suited to creating optimal health for you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f1d86a40c49cb7b5462e8785679588af828c81f","amp;dn":"The+Wisdom+of+Healing%3A+A+Natural+Mind+Body+Program+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f1d86a40c49cb7b5462e8785679588af828c81f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,29,134,164,12,73,203,123,84,98,232,120,86,121,88,138,248,40,200,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
