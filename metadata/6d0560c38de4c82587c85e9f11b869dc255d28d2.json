Faith MitchellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t answering her phone. Her front door is open. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bloodstain above the knob. Her infant daughter is hidden in a shed behind the house. All that the Georgia Bureau of Investigations taught Faith Mitchell goes out the window when she charges into her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house, gun drawn. She sees a man dead in the laundry room. She sees a hostage situation in the bedroom. What she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see is her mother. . . . ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou know what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re here for. Hand it over, and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll let her go.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When the hostage situation turns deadly, Faith is left with too many questions, not enough answers. To find her mother, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need the help of her partner, Will Trent, and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll both need the help of trauma doctor Sara Linton. But Faith isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just a cop anymoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a witness. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a suspect. The thin blue line hides police corruption, bribery, even murder. Faith will have to go up against the people she respects the most in order to find her mother and bring the truth to lightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or bury it forever. Karin SlaughterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most exhilarating novel yet is a thrilling journey through the heart and soul, where the personal and the criminal collide, and conflicted loyalties threaten to destroy reputations and ruin lives. It is the work of a master of the thriller at the top of her game, and a whirlwind of unrelenting suspense.\n\nThorn in My Side\n\nIt could have been just any night, and they could have just been any two brothers--but it wasn't, and they weren't. The scene is an Atlanta bar. The music is loud and the dance floor is packed. The good-looking brother picks up a girl. But when dark deeds ensue out in the parking lot, what happens next can only be described in two words: vintage Slaughter. From the opening scene to the last line, Thorn in My Side is as wicked as it is entertaining--an unforgettable piece of writing from one of the most beloved storytellers working today.
