While Europe seethes with conflict between Protestants and Catholics, James sees himself as a grand peacemakerÃ¢â‚¬â€and wants to make his mark by trading his children for political treaties.\nHenry, Prince of Wales, and his sister, Elizabeth, find themselves far more popular than their distrusted father, a perilous position for a child of a jealous king. When Elizabeth is introduced to one suitor, Frederick, the Elector Palatine, she feels the unexpected possibility of happiness. But her fate is not her own to chooseÃ¢â‚¬â€and when her parents brutally withdraw their support for the union, Elizabeth must take command of her own future, with the help of an unexpected ally, the slave girl Tallie, who seeks her own, very different freedom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79e54952387331aec126241863cbd4451ed8f0f","amp;dn":"The+King%27s+Daughter+-+Christie+Dickason+%28Novel%2CEpub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79e54952387331aec126241863cbd4451ed8f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,158,84,149,35,135,51,26,236,18,98,65,134,60,189,68,81,237,143,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
