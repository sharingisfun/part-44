A magical voyage through time and space, exploring the history, culture and religions that link East and West: from the Persian Empire of Alexander the Great to the huge Mongolian Empire of Kublai Khan, the destinies of highly developed civilizations intermingled until they converged to take the shape of a Eurasian civilization shared by all of us. Babylon, Persepolis, Ai-Khanoum, Baghdad, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦are virtually recreated with incomparable realism by computer generated images.\n\n\n              &lt;------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n                   \n\n\nChinese Empire. After a perilous trek of some 11 000 kilometres across steppes, mountains and deserts, the caravans entered China through the Jade Gate. For seven hundred years, one particular tribe of caravaneers, the Sogdians, held the monopoly of crossing these hostile regions and became masters in the art of organising and leading caravans between East and West. They were among the best merchants the Silk Road had ever known.\n\nTheir ancestral trading tradition had been the result of SogdianaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s privileged geographical position: the only possible route for caravans from India to reach Russia, or for those from the Mediterranean to travel to China was to cross Sogdian territory. No other trading route in history has been used for so long and by so many. In the year 674, the Sogdian city states would be conquered by the Arabs from the Middle East. They allowed the defeated Sogdians to keep their own language, Persian, but they forced them to convert to Islam. Still - looking back in history - no other people without an empire or military might has contributed more to the cultural encounter between East and West than the Sogdians.\n\n\n\nThe Episodes will be uploaded as followed:\n------------------------------------------\n\n1)Alexander The Great Conquers The World\n2)Quest For The Forgotten Alexandria\n3)Ghandhara The Renaissance Of Buddhism\n4)The Romans In China\n5)The Silk Road Unites East And West\n6)Baghdad In The Year 1000\n7)Jerusalem 1227 The Excommunicated Peace\n8)The Mongol Conqueror Kublai KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The Silk Road Unites East And West\nYear:  2004\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:48:30\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1970 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 185 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (Multisub Scandinavian) Track 1: Danish \n                                   Track 2: Swedish \n                                   Track 3: Norwegian\n                                   Track 4: Finnish\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitles Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MultiSub Scandianavian  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                              IMPORTANT: READ ME\n                             --------------------\n\nSTEP 1.\n-------\n\nTo be alble to view the subtitles you need to associate the ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Idx file&quot; and Sub file with a viewer program such as DAMN_NFO_Viewer_...  If you dont have it already download it. It is a free software program that allows you to view the subtitles.\n\nInstall it and run it.It will say something like that&quot; Lets see if it runs&quot; when you are done with the installation. Now go to the (nfo, idx,srt or sub) file and open it. Windows will now prompt you and ask if you want to search on the internet to find witch program fits or is working for the the choosed file &quot;srt nfo or sub&quot;. Choose the second option that says i will search program for my own. When done choosing, a list of all so far association programs will come up. Find DAMN_NFO Viewer and click on it.\n\nThe file is now associated with DAMN_NFO Viewer and you will not need to do thoose steps again. That goes for all srt,nfo,sub,idx files. You will have to associate them all four.It is a one time work that gives you the ability to have subtitles on all your movies and be able to open the nfo files.\n\n                            &lt;-----------------------&gt;\n\n**** Another thing thats not to be forgotten is that you have to make sure that your &quot;avi&quot; file=movie..documentary or whatever has the same name as your &quot;srt&quot; file=subtitle.\nEx: Of Men And Penguins.avi =MOVIE.............-------&gt; Of Men And Penguins.srt =Subtitle.****\nNow you are done, have fun watching your movies with subtitles....By default all my documentaries are renamed and adjusted so you dont have to do anything.\n\n\n\nSTEP 2.\n-------\n\nDownload VLC player if you dont have it, also a free software that can be found here ---&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&lt;/a&gt;    \n\nIt plays almost everything..\nWhen you are done installing it choose the movie/documentary. Start it with vlc-player.When the movie has started right click over the screen were the doc/movie is playing and choose video--&gt;&gt;  continue to the right and choose subtitle track : Now you have all four options at least for this movie uploaded today. \n\n\nTrack 1: Danish\nTrack 2: Swedish \nTrack 3: Norwegian     \nTrack 4: Finnish\n\n\nJust choose one and enjoy your evening having subtitles for your doc/movie.\n\n\n\n                               *******************\n                               **** IMPORTANT ****\n                               *******************\n\nThe idx file must be included and associated otherwise you wont be able to view the subtile(s).\n\n\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n\n\n\n\n#################################################################################\n#                                                                               #\n# SPECIAL THANKS TO: Maria Kott,Fredrik Papp &amp; Torben Okholm for the subtitles. #\n#                                                                               #\n#################################################################################\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\t\n\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:202dbc76675ffe2ee0597d72b09fe648668303b8","amp;dn":"Eurasia-The+Silk+Road+Unites+East+And+West%5BMultiS%5D%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"202dbc76675ffe2ee0597d72b09fe648668303b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,45,188,118,103,95,254,46,224,89,125,114,176,159,230,72,102,131,3,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
