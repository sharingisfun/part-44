Slash is arrested, Lizard King is assaulted by a skatepark ledge, and FurbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s board is stolen. They then turn vigilante as they stalk the mean streets of Los Angeles with Moose and Neen Williams, on the prowl for handrails, gaps and dangerous spots of that nature. The Deathwish Video is an epic and controversial film that is frank and original in its treatment of urban skateboarding and the average citizenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s helplessness in dealing with it. Various artists wrote the musical score. And watch for a young Jon Dickson in his film debut as one of the pros.\n\nVideo Width: 640\nVideo Height: 480\nBitrate: 1500\nFramerate: 30 fps\nAudio: Stereo, 160kbps\n\nPlease Seed\n\n\n\nIf you like my work and want to buy me a box of smokes or another skate video to upload, please donate to me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c6b5a5afb5b5a9b4aba7bfb2afaba4a3b4b586a1aba7afaae8a5a9ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae590cbc8f7c016dd50f6cfe5f1919986585bfdf","amp;dn":"Deathwish+Video+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae590cbc8f7c016dd50f6cfe5f1919986585bfdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,89,12,188,143,124,1,109,213,15,108,254,95,25,25,152,101,133,191,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
