As a child in an isolated village in Nova Scotia, she is drawn to Miss Babineau, an outspoken Acadian midwife with a gift for healing. Dora becomes Miss B.'s apprentice, and together they help the women of Scots Bay through infertility, difficult labours, breech births, unwanted pregnancies and even unfulfilling sex lives. \n\nFilled with details as compelling as they are surprising, The Birth House is an unforgettable tale of the struggles women have faced to have control of their own bodies and to keep the best parts of tradition alive in the world of modern medicine. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61859bc668cc57d4054e24666bcdebcafcb9363","amp;dn":"Ami+Mckay+-+The+Birth+House+Epub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61859bc668cc57d4054e24666bcdebcafcb9363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,24,89,188,102,140,197,125,64,84,226,70,102,188,222,188,175,203,147,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
