A prize of one million dollars was offered to anyone who could unravel it, but Perelman declined the winnings, and in doing so inspired journalist Masha Gessen to tell his story. Drawing on interviews with PerelmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teachers, classmates, coaches, teammates, and colleagues in Russia and the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€and informed by her own background as a math whiz raised in RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â€Gessen uncovered a mind of unrivaled computational power, one that enabled Perelman to pursue mathematical concepts to their logical (sometimes distant) end. But she also discovered that this very strength turned out to be Perelman's undoing and the reason for his withdrawal, first from the world of mathematics and then, increasingly, from the world in general.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5799edab12488a3b2737cb27d4953554800bd86f","amp;dn":"Perfect+Rigor%3A++Mathematical+Breakthrough+of+the+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5799edab12488a3b2737cb27d4953554800bd86f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,153,237,171,18,72,138,59,39,55,203,39,212,149,53,84,128,11,216,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
