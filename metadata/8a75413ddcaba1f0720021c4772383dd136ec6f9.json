To that end it includes several open source tools such as parted, gparted, partclone, clonezilla, ddrescue, and secure delete, among others.\n\n\n\n  Notes:\n\t\nPatrick Verner has decided to take this project commercial without any provision for non-profit or student discounts. $50 per year is almost twice what some commercial products go for. While it is true that Parted Magic offers more functionality, it is all via the work of others and without support, while the commercial offerings come with support.\n\t\t\nIn order to insure access to this excellent product for low-income individuals and non-profits, I am dedicating myself to purchasing this software and insuring it is available to these users. In this spirit, please, if you can afford this software, then purchase it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a75413ddcaba1f0720021c4772383dd136ec6f9","amp;dn":"pmagic_2014_04_28+PXE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a75413ddcaba1f0720021c4772383dd136ec6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,117,65,61,220,171,161,240,114,0,33,196,119,35,131,221,19,110,198,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
