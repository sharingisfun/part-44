His father Jim Swan was a prizefighter and his older brother John Swan is also a rock singer. It was actually John who had encouraged and taught Jim how to sing as he wasn't really interested at the time. His career as both a solo performer and as the lead vocalist with the rock band Cold Chisel has made him one of the most popular and best-selling Australian music artists of all time. The combination of 14 Australian Top 40 albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums, including nine No. 1s, gives Barnes the highest number of hit albums of any Australian artist.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n   1. &quot;I Can't Tell You Why&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 3:38\n   2. &quot;Out In The Blue&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 4:47\n   3. &quot;You From Me&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 3:37\n   4. &quot;Blue Hotel&quot; (Neil Finn) - 4:15\n   5. &quot;When Two Hearts Collide&quot; (with Kasey Chambers) (Jimmy Barnes) - 3:49\n   6. &quot;Red Light&quot; (Jimmy Barnes, Nick Barker) - 4:54\n   7. &quot;Everything Is Changing&quot; (Jimmy Barnes, EJ Barnes) - 4:08\n   8. &quot;Better Off Alone&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 2:59\n   9. &quot;Water Wash All Over Me&quot; (Jimmy Barnes, Glenn Cunningham, Paul Graham) - 4:22\n  10. &quot;I'm Surprised&quot; (Tex Perkins, Jimmy Barnes, Jackie Barnes) - 2:54\n  11. &quot;Losing You&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 3:35\n  12. &quot;Forgiveness&quot; (Jimmy Barnes) - 4:47\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26af1a580325ba9d650b8f65ea1357888afaf4d","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Barnes+-+Out+In+The+Blue+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26af1a580325ba9d650b8f65ea1357888afaf4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,106,241,165,128,50,91,169,214,80,184,246,94,161,53,120,136,175,175,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
