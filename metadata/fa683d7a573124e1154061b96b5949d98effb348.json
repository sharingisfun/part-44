She is best known for her 1986 hit single &quot;Two of Hearts&quot;.\n\n\nStacey Swain was born on November 30, 1958 in Fullerton, California.[1][2][3] She is the youngest of three children.[4] Her mother, Joyce Swain, was a dog breeder whose Cardigan Welsh Corgis have appeared in various Hollywood films and television series.[5] Swain once stated in a 1989 interview that she had asked for dance lessons as early as age three, but her mother &quot;made me wait until I was five&quot;.[6] By 1963, Swain was studying classical ballet and aspired to become a ballerina. In 1969, at age ten, Swain became the youngest member of the Dance Theater of Orange County, a local company that performed at benefit shows in Anaheim.[5][7] She spent a total of eleven years studying ballet and flamenco dancing.[4]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa683d7a573124e1154061b96b5949d98effb348","amp;dn":"Stacey+Q+-+2+Albums+1986+-+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa683d7a573124e1154061b96b5949d98effb348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,104,61,122,87,49,36,225,21,64,97,185,107,89,73,217,142,255,179,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
