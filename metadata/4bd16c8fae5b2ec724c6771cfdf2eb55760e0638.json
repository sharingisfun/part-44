Covers included.\n\nBasshunter aka Jonas Altberg was born 1984 in Halmstad, Sweden. He lives with his parents and younger brother 5 minutes from Swedens best beach &quot;Tylosand&quot;. He can shortly be described as a stubborn and creative person. He started to produce music in 1999 with a little help from the computer program &quot;Fruityloops&quot;. His interest in music became bigger and bigger. After a lot of demos spread over the internet, he started to get phone calls from clubs that wanted to hire him as deejay. In April 2006 he got his first real contact with the music industry when he signed a record deal with Warner Music. He released his first single 'Boten Anna' in Scandinavia and it became an instant hit. It all happened very fast, much faster then Basshunter himself could ever have expected.\n\n'Now You're Gone: The Album', is an album released by Swedish eurodance musician Basshunter on July 14th 2008. The album features English remakes of older Basshunter hits.\n\nTracks:\n01  Now You're Gone  \n02  All I Ever Wanted  \n03  Please Don't Go  \n04  I Miss You  \n05  Angel In The Night  \n06  In Her Eyes  \n07  Love You More  \n08  Camilla  \n09  Dream Girl  \n10  I Can Walk On Water  \n11  Bass Creator  \n12  Russia Privjet  \n\nBonus Tracks:\n13  Bota Anna\n14  Dota\n15  Now You're Gone [Fonzerelli Edit]\n16  All I Ever Wanted [Fonzerelli Edit]\n\nTHE VIDEOS [XviD SkidVid] \nRipped from disc, edited, no logos and encoded 720x540 and 720x540 XviD respectively.\n\nBasshunter - Now You're Gone [2007]\nBasshunter - All I Ever Wanted [2008]\n\nMore of skirgsk's audio/video releases can be found at: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=28701&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=28701&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy\n\nI (ChasHole) did not upload this I am just reuploading it so maybe more people can download.
