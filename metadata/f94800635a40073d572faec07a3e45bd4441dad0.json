However, since my rips also features original English audio tracks, and video quality surpasses most rips on the Internet, i decided to release it worldwide. Be sure to know how to switch audio streams, else this release won't do you any good ;). To see subtitles correctly, set DirectVodSub (or similar filter) to plaintext mode, because position info from subtitles track is wrong. This is well-known bug of my ttxt-ripping implementation, but i don't have time to fix it or fix resulting subtitles.\n\nThanks to:\n  DisneyJazz.net\n  Doom9.org\n  Audacity developers\n  Stax\nSpecial thanks to:\n  MaMaDx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f94800635a40073d572faec07a3e45bd4441dad0","amp;dn":"TMNT_2003_Season_02_x264_AAC_DVDRip_by_LRN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f94800635a40073d572faec07a3e45bd4441dad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,72,0,99,90,64,7,61,87,47,174,192,122,62,69,189,68,65,218,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
