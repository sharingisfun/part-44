The album is unique in that it features the dual vocals of Benjamin Perri and drummer Francis Mark. Perri provides the hardcore-esque shouts while Mark sings and occasionally contributes background screams. This style was very innovative at the time, and earned the band widespread praise\n\nHailing from Long Island, From Autumn to Ashes are one of the current leading lights in hardcore metal. Never allowing themselves to be totally pigeonholed the band draw influence from across the musical spectrum. As drummer Fran Mark explains, It&amp;#039;s almost like we&amp;#039;re a band with an identity crisis. We don&amp;#039;t settle down into one style, really. It&amp;#039;s definitely from a hardcore background and has hardcore elements. But there are other members of the band that bring rock elements to the table.\n\nToo Bad You&amp;#039;re Beautiful illustrates FATA&amp;#039;s range and sophistication to blistering effect. Produced by Killswitch Engage&amp;#039;s Adam D it leaps from the the almighty Cherry Kiss to the mellow ballad Chloroform Perfume through to the ten minute epic that is, Short Stories With Tragic Endings. Too Bad You&amp;#039;re Beautiful is an album of awesome power and spectacular songs. It has the potential to drag the band from out of the metal ghetto and expose them to the widest audience possible. Essential, mesmerising and totally brilliant, this is the sound of modern metal.\n\nEnjoy! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:998f8a28eb5107693c486434e202020077d79e39","amp;dn":"From+Autumn+To+Ashes+-+Too+Bad+You%5C%27re+Beautiful","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"998f8a28eb5107693c486434e202020077d79e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,143,138,40,235,81,7,105,60,72,100,52,226,2,2,0,119,215,158,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
