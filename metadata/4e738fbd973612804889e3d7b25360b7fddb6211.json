As he tries to put a stop to this unstoppable and seemingly unkillable killer, the Black Coat begins to discover that these murders are just the beginning of a much larger plot against the Colonies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more at stake than the lives of a few innocent women. The future of a new nation may be hanging in the balance!\n\n\n\nThe Black Coat/ Nathaniel Finch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The resourceful leader of a network of spies for the Continental Congress. Nathaniel Finch is a respected business man and the editor of a weekly newspaper in New York City. As the Black Coat, he takes on the assignments that are too dangerous for other agents. To aid in his work, he has created a vast array of tools, weapons, and gadgets that give him the edge in most situations. More often than not, however, the Black Coat relies primarily on his wits, luck, and skill with a sword to get him home in one piece. The Black Coat is incredibly brilliant and is ahead of his time in many ways although his natural curiosity and self assuredness can often lead him to make hasty decisions.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e738fbd973612804889e3d7b25360b7fddb6211","amp;dn":"The+Black+Coat+-+A+Call+To+Arms+%282006%29+%28DarthScanner-DCP%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e738fbd973612804889e3d7b25360b7fddb6211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,115,143,189,151,54,18,128,72,137,227,215,178,83,96,183,253,219,98,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
