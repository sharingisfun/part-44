The group travels to the manor, where a number of strange occurrences have been reported. The vicar has called in an exorcist, who seems smitten with Rebeccas&amp;#039; charms. Phileas, who left the Secret Service after his father&amp;#039;s actions got his brother killed, is none too pleased or interested in the whole affair. Passepartout eventually discovers that Boniface&amp;#039;s body wasn&amp;#039;t stolen, but that the bones were reduced to dust by an electrical storm that triggered a discharge. The same discharge reanimated the skeleton that was in the crypt, that was brought back from the Crusades by Boniface&amp;#039;s ancestor. The vicar believes the bones are those of an angel, but Jules believes they are of an alien.\n\nWriter: John Brown\nDirector: Eleanore Lindo\nGuest star: Stephen Bogaert (Erasthmus Fogg), David Ferry (von Kessler), Adrian Hough (Dr. Sanderson), Elizabeth Shepherd (Mrs. Partridge), Tony Robinow (Colin Yardley), Ian D.
