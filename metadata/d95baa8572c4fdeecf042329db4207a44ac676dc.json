AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ methodology, known as the Zone System, takes what the viewer will seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the final printÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½into consideration at the beginning of the photographic process, rather than focusing strictly on what the photographer sees. Once this concept, called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprevisualization,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is presented and defined, the book then follows a step-by-step approach to incorporating these ideas into all aspects of the photographic process, including lighting, exposure, development or digital editing, and printmaking or output of digital images. Whether working in film or digital media, these steps will foster early accuracy and elicit better source material from a camera, which allows for greater control and contrast in the lab or on a printer.  \nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 128 pages\n    * Publisher: Amherst Media, Inc.
