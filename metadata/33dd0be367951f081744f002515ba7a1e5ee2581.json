This has led to the design of spatial access methods to enable the effective &amp; efficient management of spatial objects.\n\nR-trees have a simplicity of structure &amp; together with their resemblance to the B-tree, allow developers to incorporate them easily into existing database management systems for the support of spatial query processing.\n\nThis book provides an extensive survey of the R-tree evolution, studying the applicability of the structure &amp; its variations to efficient query processing, accurate proposed cost models, &amp; implementation issues like concurrency control and parallelism. Written for database researchers, designers &amp; programmers as well as graduate students, this comprehensive monograph will be a welcome addition to the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33dd0be367951f081744f002515ba7a1e5ee2581","amp;dn":"R-trees+-+Theory+and+Applications.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33dd0be367951f081744f002515ba7a1e5ee2581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,221,11,227,103,149,31,8,23,68,240,2,81,91,167,161,229,238,37,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
