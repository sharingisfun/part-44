He currently lives in Choisel and is a member of the Academie Goncourt. His autobiography has been translated and published as The Wind Spirit (Beacon Press, 1988).\n\n\nReview\n\n\nThe Four Wise Men struck me as a true masterpiece.\n\n(Lewis Jones, New Statesman)\n\n\nA work of extraordinary clarity.\n\n(Jonathan Baumbach, New York Times Book Review)\n\n\nThere is a real touch of magic in this novel.\n\n(The Atlantic)\n\n\nThis is a novel of high achievement. Tournier works to assert an apologia of Christianity and its underlying message of love, and he does so with finely paced arguing, well-balanced counterarguing and, most importantly, genuine intellectual energy... This may be more than a novel of high achievement, in fact; it may be the best work so far of a truly daring writer.\n\n(America)\n\n\nTournier is an ambitious and profound writer.\n\n(Washington Post)\n\n\nBook Description\n\n&quot;This may be more than a novel of high achievement, in fact; it may be the best work so far of a truly daring writer.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€ America","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68fd28878d99d2c1f5b261b10d01e089509db90b","amp;dn":"Michel+Tournier+-+The+Four+Wise+Men+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68fd28878d99d2c1f5b261b10d01e089509db90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,253,40,135,141,153,210,193,245,178,97,177,13,1,224,137,80,157,185,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
