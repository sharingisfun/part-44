The tracks sound more arena like and the sound is more comparable to the in game tracks used for the superstars entrances. As Damien Sandow would say &quot;You're welcome&quot;.\n\nP.S I will be uploading the &quot;WWE '13 - Updated Entrance Music&quot; sometime soon after WWE '13 realeases. So far there are 22 tracks and my change to more that includes Wade Barrett's V2 current theme and Road Doggs Theme with &quot;ass&quot; encluded for anyone who wants the track. Right now I am done getting the themes Just need To add the in game arena effects to all of them.
