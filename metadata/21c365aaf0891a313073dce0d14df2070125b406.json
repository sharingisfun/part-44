Both are sustained by violence and dominated by men - and both claim to be the favored children of Gela, the woman who came to Eden long ago on a boat that could cross the stars, and became the mother of them all.\n\nWhen young Starlight Brooking meets a handsome and powerful man from across Worldpool, she believes he will offer an outlet for her ambition and energy. But she has no inkling that she will become a stand-in for Gela herself, and wear Gela's fabled ring on her own finger - or that in this role, powerful and powerless all at once, she will try to change the course of Eden's history.\n\nRead by:\nJayne Entwistle\nBruce Mann\nHeather Wilds\nSuzan Crowley\nNicholas Guy Smith\nLucy Rayner\nHannah Curtis\nKatharine McEwan\nEmma Bering\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nLength: 15 hrs and 35 mins\nSeries: Dark Eden, Book 2\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:05-12-15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c365aaf0891a313073dce0d14df2070125b406","amp;dn":"Chris+Beckett+-+Mother+of+Eden+%28Dark+Eden+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c365aaf0891a313073dce0d14df2070125b406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,195,101,170,240,137,26,49,48,115,220,224,209,77,242,7,1,37,180,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
