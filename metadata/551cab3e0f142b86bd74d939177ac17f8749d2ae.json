After many days of hard travel, we climbed to the summit of a large ridge along the Sierra cordillera. At a height of 10,000 feet I could look over an immense plain that extended to the south and down to the Gulf of Mexico. From that vantage point I saw a marvellous city that extended over a great area. There were high, white turrets that glistened in the sun.&quot;\n\nLloyd Stephens motioned for his porters to march toward the city. As he said later, &quot;I was extremely excited at the thought of finding a lost metropolis in this dense green jungle.&quot;\n\nNot allowed in\n\n&quot;This is as far as a white man may go,&quot; an elderly Indian told Stephens. &quot;The people in that city know that white invaders have conquered this land. They murder any white man who enters the city.&quot;\n\n&quot;How have they remained undiscovered for so many years?&quot; asked the explorer.\n\n&quot;They have no coins, no livestock, or domestic animals,&quot; replied his informant. &quot;The buildings you see are not inhabited. They have left the city and moved underground to save themselves from the white invaders.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do they live underground?&quot; asked Stephens. &quot;Without sunlight, they would surely die after a few weeks in a cave.&quot;\n\nHow they live with no sunlight\n\nThe old Indian looked at the explorer with amusement. &quot;There are many secrets in this world,&quot; he responded. &quot;These people have known the formula for the great light for thousands of years.&quot;\n\n\nLETTER WRITING: Would you like to know what kind of letters people wrote 2,400 years ago? Would you like to see an actual letter that a scared passenger wrote on board a ship?\n\nMICRO TECHNOLOGY: Did you know that thousands of years ago, was able to manufacture micro-filigree objects from 1.2 inches (3 cm) down to an incredible 0.003 millimeters - something our technology is only now just beginning to achieve?\n\nMUSICAL INSTRUMENTS: Were you aware that a reed musical instrument of ancient Greece is virtually the same as one played in the Solomon Islands and the Andes highlands of South America? It has an almost identical structure. Even the pitch is the same.\n\nUNDERSEA TUNNEL: Did Gibraltar's apes really migrate through an undersea tunnel from Africa?\n\nMYSTERY ON MARS: Strange tear-shaped objects recently discovered on Mars were described also by our ancient ancestors? How did they know?\n\nPOWER DRILLS: Did you know that Egyptian drills were turning &quot;500 times faster&quot; than modern power drills?\n\nCEMENT TOO STRONG TO BREAK: Have you heard about the cement, as thin as a sheet of tissue paper, that joins the massive stones of the Great Pyramid? And can hold a vertical joint as large as 5 feet by 7 feet in area. The cement is so tough that the limestone blocks will break before the cement gives way. Modern chemists can analyse this cement, but are UNABLE TO PRODUCE IT.\n\nVALLEYS OF POISON: Do you know about the mysterious valleys of poison on Indonesia's island of Java?\n\nLOST AUSTRALIAN CITY: Have you heard of the secret city of Burrungu, which the Australian aborigines claim is hidden in the remote hinterlands of northern Australia? Three white men who have visited its remains reported ruined walls, stone houses, wide courtyards, and stately arches that look down upon statues set along tree-shaded streets.\n\nBOOMERANGS: Were you aware that not only the Australian aborigines, but also ancient races in Arizona, in the Arctic Circle, India, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, the Pacific and Africa, all used the boomerang?\n\nTAXIS WITH METERS: Have you heard about the 'taxis' complete with automatic meters that were used by the ancient Romans.\n\nEGYPTIAN CAVES IN GRAND CANYON: Did you know that earlier reports of Egyptian mummies and\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
