All work done by VIruz.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 01.046.014 (05/09/14)\n\n- fixed spotlight cone visible during flashing \n- fixed flashing control tooltip text \n- fixed faction screen crash \n- added different icons for action toggle/on/off \n- fixed character crash \n- fixed sensor toolbar sync \n- fixed sensor station detection \n- fixed terminal crash\n\nUpdate 01.046.011 (04/09/14)\n\nSummary:\nThe sensor block has been added; you can configure what happens when something enters or leaves from the sensorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s field - the configuration is similar to the button panel. It's also possible to set a filter, so it will trigger events only for small ships, large ships, floating objects or characters. In the future we will add an option to allow filtering based on friend/foe status. Also, flashing options have been added for lights; you can create navigation lights and runways - multiple lights can be synced. Warhead has now timer and also can be detonated remotely through the terminal.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- sensor block\n- flashing lights\n- warhead terminal controls\n\nFixes:\n- added multiplayer lag/slowdown compensation (helps with rubber banding)\n- added possibility for name change during dedicated server setup\n- fixed issue when character moved objects locally by pushing (server ignored it)\n- fixed connector still yellow when turned OFF\n- fixed turret rectangle visibility\n- fixed unlocked connectors allowing item transfer\n- fixed rocket launcher not remembering option to use conveyor system\n- fixed crash when locking connectors\n- fixed completed solar panels do not have sun reflection\n- fixed gravity generator model bug\n- fixed landing gear attached to pistons could not be unlocked\n\n*Known Issues*\n- changing the field of the sensor or loading the game will activate the sensor. This will be changed in the future updates.\n- you can't assign the same sensor action for both entering and exiting the sensor's field\n\nUpdate 01.045.013 (29/08/14)\n\n- fixed crash in toolbar\n- fixed crash in terminal screen\n- fixed glass single side rendering issue\n- fixed thruster glare rendering issue\n- fixed assembler block not added when blueprints in queue were missing\n- fixed 'Arc furnace' building progress models\n- fixed blank assembler\n- changed name of 'Blast furnace' to 'Arc furnace'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cfe6979c5ff714526897f1c379d076ed85464e4","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.046.014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cfe6979c5ff714526897f1c379d076ed85464e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,254,105,121,197,255,113,69,38,137,127,28,55,157,7,110,216,84,100,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
