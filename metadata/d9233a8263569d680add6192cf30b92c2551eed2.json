Usingreal aerial photography for scenery means that the views you see from yourvirtual cockpit are literally transformed into the real thing - you see exactlywhat the pilots of the survey aircraft saw when they acquired the aerialphotography. VFR Photographic Scenery Ireland for FSX gives youunsurpassed photographic detail at a resolution of  1.2/m pixel detail with terrain mesh at 10mwhich replaces your default scenery.\nVFR Generation X: V9 - Ireland East is one of two titles each at over 35,000 sq.Km that cover the country of Eire\n\nUnparalleled Terrain detail:\nWith a 5m terrain mesh data from Getmapping's latest aerial surveys, VFR Generation X gives users minute topographic detail that shows every lump and bump - all fully correlated to provide the perfect fit with the aerial photography, adding dramatically to the immersion that this synthetic environment provides.\n\nUltra High-Definition Photographic Scenery:\nWith this volume you can expect ultra-high definition resolution for the entire area.The resolution has been set  0.60cm throughout. The end result is smooth frame rates with exacting detail for your VFR flights.\n\nSpectacular Water Effects:\nThe water bodies have been designed to retain the natural water colours shown by the aerial photography as far as possible, again adding to the scenery's immersion. In addition, they will provide a moving, reflective surface that will allow float aircraft operations, and will even let you see through to sub-surface features like sand bars and underwater channels.\n\nCompatibility with Eiresim\nTo ensure compatibility with other content for Ireland, Horizon has been coordinating efforts with the talented scenery designers from Eiresim, who have made airfields and airports  for the same area in stunning 3D with blends for this scenery for a seamless transition.\n\nEnhanced Performance:\nSmooth frame rates with crisp, sharp photographic scenery - VFR Generation X has been specifically designed to optimise performance and reduce the effects of blurry scenery textures, even on lower spec. systems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNot my own realese.
