In the vein of One World?s Zen Connection series and Buddha Bar, CafÃƒÂ© Nirvana brings together some renowned names in the dance music world such as Bent, Doctor Rockit a.k.a. Matthew Herbert, Chungking, Fila Brazillia, Ultra Nate and more. Mostly vocal tracks, the double CD has a diverse myriad of downbeat sounds on offer, and is more organic than much of the electronic elevator music available on other new-age chill-out compilations. \nFrom the Irish vocal styling on Bent?s Sunday Boy, reminiscent of The Cranberries and Sinead O?Connor, to the Indian sitar-laced and bhangra vibes on Baul Dimension, Badmarsh and Outside tracks; to jazzy scatting on Ikon?s Mogul Modal, to dreamy cascading house courtesy of Mr Haywood and IO; Latin flicks via Shawn Lee \nand Dos Hombros, and downbeat vocal funk on Grand National?s Peanut Dreams and Outside?s Blue Sky, there are bass beats to invigorate, lyrics to tug the heartstrings and melodies to float away to aplenty.\nThere are romantic crooning love sick boys, sexy swaggering femmes, gleaming harmonising flower children and sweet ethereal humming fairies! At times you feel like you?ve stepped into a ?70s hippie musical ? thanks to Neon Heights Listen To The Music and Chungking?s Les Fleurs particularly, while Kimbu Kimra?s Raise The Dead brings you back to the present with some funky percussive deep house beats. It?s no surprise that Doctor Rockit?s installment of the classic French sounding CafÃƒÂ© De Flore brings some much-awaited swing to the compilation. Other highlights are Fila Brazilla?s subtle nostalgic grooves on Septentrio, Josee?s beautifully lazy Days In Life and Dos Hombres cascading filters and Latin guitar on The Alkemyst track.\n\n\n \nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db93a468ba295393e9f4d112d5f9ed63cafb74b","amp;dn":"CAF%C3%89+NIRVANA+-+The+Cream+Of+Lounge+Cuisine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db93a468ba295393e9f4d112d5f9ed63cafb74b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,185,58,70,139,162,149,57,62,159,77,17,45,95,158,214,60,175,183,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
