Not that this is a bad thing. Following firmly in the footsteps of its predecessor, Keep Yer Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnd on It is packed with catchy hooks, and the sound is rich throughout. Both &quot;Call Out for Mercy&quot; and &quot;Stand Back in Amazement&quot; are bona fide rock numbers and stand strong and hold up well against any other of their ilk, while String Driven Thing's psych-tinged take on the Beatles' &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; is one of the standouts on the album; it's loose and free without sprawling and overall a nice reinvention.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177e922809e17ce15c80c6a4b03334918c0f17fb","amp;dn":"String+Driven+Thing+-+Keep+Yer+%27And+On+It+%281975%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177e922809e17ce15c80c6a4b03334918c0f17fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,126,146,40,9,225,124,225,92,128,198,164,176,51,52,145,140,15,23,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
