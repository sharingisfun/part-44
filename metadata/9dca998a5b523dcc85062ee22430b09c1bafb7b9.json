Two fierce warriors woke the ancient gods with their battle. But it was not the time for mankind to be judged, so the survivor, Pajaro-Jaguar was transformed to stone due his massive accumulation of power and decapitated by the god Chac to seal that power within the stone.\n\nNow in 2065, the Lucha Libre, a worldwide free-for-all attracts a myriad of combatants for the lucrative and challenging title of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Champion of the World.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unknown to these hopeful gladiators is that the outcome of the their secular tournament will determine their worthiness to battle the gods when long-denied ancient power is released.\n\nInspired by the Pre-Colombian legends of his native Mexico, writer/artist, Francisco Ruiz Velasco, incorporated Mayan religious figures for his tale of the ultimate battle for the fate of man.\n\n\n\nShouts to Coldkiller for the scans, and ZCultFM, on the strength.
