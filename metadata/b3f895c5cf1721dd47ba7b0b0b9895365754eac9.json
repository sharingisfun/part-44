Instead of spending her summer interning for her astronomy major, she would fly to Spain where sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d spend a few weeks teaching conversational English to businessmen and women, all while enjoying free room and board at an isolated resort. But while Vera expected to get a tan, meet new people and stuff herself with wine and paella, she never expected to fall in love. \n\nMateo Casalles is unlike anyone Vera has ever known, let alone anyone sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usually attracted to. While Vera is a pierced and tatted free spirit with a love for music and freedom, Mateo is a successful businessman from Madrid, all sharp suits and cocky Spanish charm. Yet, as the weeks go on, the two grow increasingly close and their relationship changes from purely platonic to somethingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦more. \n\n\nTHIS EBOOK IN EPUB FORMAT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f895c5cf1721dd47ba7b0b0b9895365754eac9","amp;dn":"Love%2C+In+English+-+Karina+Halle.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f895c5cf1721dd47ba7b0b0b9895365754eac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,248,149,197,207,23,33,221,71,186,123,11,11,152,149,54,87,84,234,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
