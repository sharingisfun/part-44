A package of icons contains icons to replace most of the common icons on your Windows PC.\n\nOverview\nWhat makes IconPackager special is that unlike Microsoft's themes which only change a few icons, IconPackager changes hundreds of icons. A package of icons contains icons to replace most of the common icons on your Windows PC.\n\nEverything from &quot;My Computer&quot;, &quot;Recycle Bin&quot;, Folders, all the way to specific file format icons such as .doc and .xls files and any other file type a user wishes to use. With its shell integration, IconPackager also allows users browsing through their system to right-click on any file and go to the added &quot;Icon&quot; tab and change the icon.\n\nInstall instructions:\n\nInstall IconPackager.\nCopy file from crack folder into installation directory replacing the file there of the same name.\n(example directory: C:/Program Files/Stardock/Object Desktop/IconPackager)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/iconpackager/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/iconpackager/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPlease help your fellow pirates by seeding after download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea3351ad1126dd4b19acf192420d48b4093d279","amp;dn":"Icon+Packager+4.20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea3351ad1126dd4b19acf192420d48b4093d279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,163,53,26,209,18,109,212,177,154,207,25,36,32,212,139,64,147,210,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
