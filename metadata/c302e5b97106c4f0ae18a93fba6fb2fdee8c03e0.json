It's tempting to consider Adua a le Compagne a late addition to the neorealist canon. However, Italian cinema had changed a lot by the end of the 1950s and while Adua e le Compagne does deal with contemporary social issues, the technique of the film is very differrent, with its professional cast (including Simone Signoret as Adua and Marcello Mastroianni as her lover) and jazzy score.\n\nElenco: Marcello Mastroianni, Simone Signoret, Sandra Milo, Emmanuelle Riva, Gina Rovere, Claudio Gora, Ivo Garrani \nDireÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o: Antonio Pietrangeli\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053570/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053570/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c302e5b97106c4f0ae18a93fba6fb2fdee8c03e0","amp;dn":"Adua.e.le.Compagne.1960.DVDRip.XViD.MKO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c302e5b97106c4f0ae18a93fba6fb2fdee8c03e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,2,229,185,113,6,196,240,174,24,169,63,186,111,178,253,238,140,3,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
