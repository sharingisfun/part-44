It's smart, angry and very funny -- a pretty lethal combination -- and continues the critique of contemporary American the comic began on his first album, Good Day to Cross a River. If you saw the special on Comedy Central but didn't love it, give it another chance. Midlife Vices is one of the best comedy albums of 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ea6e3b953b4a98cfacace2a83eb45131ebca547","amp;dn":"Greg+Giraldo+-+Midlife+Vices","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ea6e3b953b4a98cfacace2a83eb45131ebca547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,166,227,185,83,180,169,140,250,202,206,42,131,235,69,19,30,188,165,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
