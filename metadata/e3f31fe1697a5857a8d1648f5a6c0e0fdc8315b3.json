[two versions]\n\nI thought you might find this interesting. Karajan recorded the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto twice for DG with the BPO. The first time was in 1965 with Christian Ferras, and the second was in 1987 with Anne-Sophie Mutter. Here are both versions. In terms of tempo, they are identical except for the finale, which is a little more relaxed in the newer version. The recorded sound reflects the times: analogue and digital. You decide which you prefer.\n\nAs always, please enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f31fe1697a5857a8d1648f5a6c0e0fdc8315b3","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky+-+Violin+Concerto+-+Karajan%2C+BPO+-+Ferras%2C+Mutter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f31fe1697a5857a8d1648f5a6c0e0fdc8315b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,243,31,225,105,122,88,87,168,209,100,143,90,108,14,15,220,131,21,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
