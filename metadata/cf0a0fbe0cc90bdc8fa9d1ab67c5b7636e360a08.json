This remarkable process will have quilters making wholecloth quilts in an entirely new way. The vibrant and exquisite coloration of these quilts is stunning. Amazingly, it takes only simple tools and easily mastered techniques to achieve the same results for yourself. Everything needed for this colorful process is clearly explained. Start with plain cloth, free-motion quilt your designs, then color and shade the motifs and background areas for a breathtaking new look. You ll love the unique quilts you can make with Irena's guidance!\nThis is a beautiful book on a very simple concept. There are several projects to try out and an interesting section in the front about designing your own quilts. I have not yet ordered some of the color setting products, so have only been creating the designs and not coloring. You may be able to substitute other color fixers but I would suggest testing on very small samples and then washing them repeatedly to see what the results are. I really like this book! -J.

The quality is not as good as I would have liked it to be and the last few pages are missing. But that is all you can get at present.
