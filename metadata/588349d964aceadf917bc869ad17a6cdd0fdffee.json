No, Honestly featured the real-life married couple of Pauline Collins and John Alderton respectively as Clara and Charles Danby (or CD), a newlywed couple living in London.\n\nThe character of Clara was a ditzy dreamer who hoped to write books for children. Charles Danby by contrast was a struggling actor with a more serious streak.\n\nAt the start of each episode, the couple appeared in front of an audience telling stories about their first meeting, courtship and life as newlyweds. The entire programme, therefore, was a series of flashbacks as the couple recounted the earlier days of their romance.\n\nFilled with witty and sparkling banter, the episodes featured comic situations ranging from problems with mistaken identity to decorating and makeover mishaps.\n\nIn homage to George Burns and Gracie Allen, CD would end each episode with the phrase &quot;Say goodnight, Clara.&quot;\n\nThe series is based on the novels Coronet Among the Weeds and Coronet Among the Grass written by Charlotte Bingham, who was co-creator of the TV series with her husband Terence Brady.\n\n[/b]The theme song for No, Honestly was written and performed by Lynsey De Paul. It peaked on the UK charts at number 7.[/b]\n \n \n \n \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_Honestly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No,_Honestly&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n \n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n\n\n \nNo Honestly - S01 (13x25 Minutes) \n\n\n \n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : No Honestly.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 27mn 4s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 808 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : No\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 27mn 4s\nBitrate                     : 1 695 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.226\nStream size                 : 328 MB (94%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 27mn 4s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 99.4 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 19.3 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 517 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:588349d964aceadf917bc869ad17a6cdd0fdffee","amp;dn":"No+Honestly+-+Series+01+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"588349d964aceadf917bc869ad17a6cdd0fdffee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,131,73,217,100,172,234,223,145,123,200,105,173,23,166,205,208,253,255,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
