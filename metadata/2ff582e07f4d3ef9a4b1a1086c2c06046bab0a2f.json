Andrej, a lonesome cowboy, is informed of his brother's death - one of the monks - and starts a search for the gang, and to find who the murder of his brother was. Among the lawless and godless men, a fight for getting the better part of the loot is taking place - and blood is flowing as much as bullets. The infighting ends was Sancho kills his own second-in-command, and rests the only gangster alive, owner of the sacred, and valuable relic. It's then that Andrej confronts him, and once again blood calls to blood, before the precious loot can be returned to the surviving monks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff582e07f4d3ef9a4b1a1086c2c06046bab0a2f","amp;dn":"Sangue+chiama+sangue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff582e07f4d3ef9a4b1a1086c2c06046bab0a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,245,130,224,127,77,62,249,164,177,161,8,108,44,6,4,107,171,10,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
