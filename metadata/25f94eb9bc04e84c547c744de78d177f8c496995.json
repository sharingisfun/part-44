It's also their most  \ndaring and confident LP yet, combining retrofuturistic            \nelectronics, crisp danceable beats and assertive vocals that are  \nmore upfront than ever before.\n'Surveillance Culture' is the first TPM album on the new          \nComplete Control Productions label: &quot;It's fantastic to finally    \nbe able to work with like-minded people and we have a lot of      \npromising things up our sleeves. We're heavily involved with the  \nlabel and it's definitely a long term commitment on our part.     \nWatch out for lots more mayhem later in 2011!&quot;\n\nHaving experimented with samplers, synths and drum machines       \nsince the late 1980's, Anders Karlsson released his first work    \nas The Pain Machinery in 1992. The initial idea was to mix the    \nraw energy of UK street punk and the sound exploring              \npossibilities of electro/industrial music. Later joined by        \nvocalist Jonas Hedberg, The Pain Machinery has continued to       \nexpand on their original formula through the years. The band,     \nfrequently described as the missing link between punk, house and  \nElectronic Body Music, has gained a lasting reputation for their\nintense and physical live shows around Europe.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f94eb9bc04e84c547c744de78d177f8c496995","amp;dn":"The+Pain+Machinery+-+Surveillance+Culture+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f94eb9bc04e84c547c744de78d177f8c496995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,249,78,185,188,4,232,76,84,124,116,77,231,141,23,127,140,73,105,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
