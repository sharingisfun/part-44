In this world, robots are part of everyday life, and they contribute in various aspects of society. &quot;Shinki&quot; are 15-centimeter-tall (about 6-inch-tall) cute partners made to assist humans. Equipped with intelligence and emotions, they devote themselves to serving their &quot;Masters.&quot;\n\nThese Shinki can even be equipped with weapons and armor to fight each other. Such Shinki are named &quot;Busou Shinki&quot; (literally, &quot;armed divine princesses&quot;). In particular, the Shinki Ann (Arnval), Aines (Altines), and Lene (Altlene) serve a high school freshman named Masato. Things change when a new Shinki, the bellicose Strarf, joins them.\n\n\n\nGenres: Action, Sci-Fi\n\n\n\nRelease date : October 05, 2012\n\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51330a8853d80dd699cbbff0766650853eb59c4c","amp;dn":"%5BCommie%5D+Busou+Shinki+-+01+%5B77A1EB68%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51330a8853d80dd699cbbff0766650853eb59c4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,51,10,136,83,216,13,214,153,203,191,240,118,102,80,133,62,181,156,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
