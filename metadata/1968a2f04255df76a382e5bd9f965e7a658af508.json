The settings range from the almost spartan (intimate, beautiful versions of &quot;Angel Eyes,&quot; with guitarist Barney Kessel, and &quot;Lush Life,&quot; with pianist Oscar Peterson) to orchestras and big bands, while the material ranges from classic standards to bop tunes like &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot; to the Lennon-McCartney &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Buy Me Love.&quot; What ties it all together, of course, is Fitzgerald&amp;#039;s singular talent, her ability to find the potential in her material and expand it with her unique vocal abilities. This set is a tribute to producer Norman Granz as well, for he consistently worked to involve Fitzgerald in the fruitful collaborations that enliven this set. There are meetings with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie, as well as excerpts from the Songbook recordings and a number of live performances.\n\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
