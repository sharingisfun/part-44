Still in limited release nearly 34 years after its premiere, it has the longest-running theatrical release in film history. It gained notoriety as a midnight movie in 1977 when audiences began participating with the film in theaters across the United States. &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; is the first movie from a major film studio, such as 20th Century Fox, to be in the midnight movie market. Widely known by mainstream audiences, it has a large international following and is one of the most well known and financially successful midnight movies of all time. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;\n\nThe film, considered a cult classic, is an adaptation of the British musical stage production The Rocky Horror Show. Richard O'Brien, author of the stage show, was assisted by Jim Sharman in writing the screenplay. The movie introduces Tim Curry and features Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick along with cast members from the original Kings Road production of the play performed at the Royal Court Theatre.\nContents\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f486a472c86d1b6e4325294dc1546a6557efffa1","amp;dn":"The+Rocky+Horror+Picture+Show+%5BMP3-M3U-Log-Cov-CD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f486a472c86d1b6e4325294dc1546a6557efffa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,134,164,114,200,109,27,110,67,37,41,77,193,84,106,101,87,239,255,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
