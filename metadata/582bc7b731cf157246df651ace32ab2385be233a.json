Isolated beyond the central Himalayas, its summit has never been scaled, but for centuries the mountain has been ritually circled by Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims. \n\nColin Thubron joins these pilgrims, after an arduous trek from Nepal, through the high passes of Tibet, to the magical lakes beneath the slopes of Kailas itself. He talks to secluded villagers and to monks in their decaying monasteries; he tells the stories of exiles and of eccentric explorers from the West. \n\nYet he is also walking on a pilgrimage of his own. Having recently witnessed the death of the last of his family, his trek around the great mountain awakes an inner landscape of love and grief, restoring precious fragments of his own past.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9571766-to-a-mountain-in-tibet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9571766-to-a-mountain-in-tibet&lt;/a&gt; - 3.6/5\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582bc7b731cf157246df651ace32ab2385be233a","amp;dn":"Colin+Thubron+-+To+a+Mountain+in+Tibet.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582bc7b731cf157246df651ace32ab2385be233a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,43,199,183,49,207,21,114,70,223,101,26,206,50,171,35,133,190,35,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
