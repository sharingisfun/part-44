A member of John Lee Hooker's '80s Coast to Coast Band, Rogers produced and played on Hooker's Grammy-winning comeback album, The Healer, and its follow-up, Mr. Lucky. During the early '70s, Rogers played with a variety of Bay Area bar bands. In 1976, he and harpist David Burgin recorded A Foot in the Door, which was released on Waterhouse Records. For the next few years, he played in various bands before he formed his own, the Delta Rhythm Kings, in 1980. Two years later, John Lee Hooker asked Rogers to join his Coast to Coast Band and the guitarist accepted. Rogers stayed with Hooker for four years, leaving in 1986. That same year, he released his debut album, 'Chops Not Chaps', on Blind Pig Records. The record was successful with blues audiences and was nominated for a W.C. Handy Award.\n'...'Slidewinder' is one of Roy Rogers's best albums, and first album for Blind Pig; a collection of smoking hot contemporary blues, ranging from jacked-up rocking boogie numbers and dirty Chicago blues to stripped-down acoustic numbers. It all works equally well, especially the two stellar duets with pianist Allen Toussaint. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e9f1a529a31a57d318d01cb0884844f10c7d87","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Roy+Rogers+-+Slidewinder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e9f1a529a31a57d318d01cb0884844f10c7d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,233,241,165,41,163,26,87,211,24,208,28,176,136,72,68,241,12,125,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
