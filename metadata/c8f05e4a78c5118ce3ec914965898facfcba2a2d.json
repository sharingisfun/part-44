Along with Weezers Blue Album, Dear You is one of the cornerstones upon which emo and late 90s punk-pop were built. Certainly Jimmy Eat World wore out their copy, as Bleed American sounds like a less produced younger brother, and Dashboard Confessionals whole oeuvre sounds like a lesser version of Dear Yous acoustic Unlisted Track.  Dear You is one of the best rock records of the 90s and a fitting last testament to a great band.\n\nReleased: 1995\nLabel: Blackball \nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative, Indie\nQuality: mp3\n\nTracks:\n\n  1.
