Most people aren't aware of the antiquity of Ireland and its importance in the origins of civilization, he noted. In fact, the roots of Egyptian thought and Christianity actually extend back to the Druids, he contended.\n\nThe sun will cross the galactic center on Dec. 21, 2012 according to the Maya, said Tsarion, who added that this time marks the end of the age of Pisces, as well as the end of one entire Zodiac cycle itself. It will bring a cleansing period where the kind of life we're used to will pass away, he believes, with dramatic changes to relationships and domestic structures.\n\nTsarion described his Timegnosis system, in which he combines numerology with astrology to yield personal &quot;timescopes&quot; that offer daily predictions designed for empowerment. He also shared his theories about the &quot;subversive use&quot; of symbolism in advertising and the media, arguing that a kind of &quot;Psychic Dictatorship&quot; seeks to erode the moral fabric of human beings through symbolic imagery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c352201f9a8dcf2ff1c282d8d53e5fd694645d","amp;dn":"Classic.Shows.C2C.May.24.2006-komie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c352201f9a8dcf2ff1c282d8d53e5fd694645d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,195,82,32,31,154,141,207,47,241,194,130,216,213,62,95,214,148,100,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
