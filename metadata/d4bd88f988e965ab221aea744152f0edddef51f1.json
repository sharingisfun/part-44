Think Supreme Power, only with more scifi to it, or Heroes without the recycled X-men plots and you&amp;#039;ve got the basic idea of this series. There are only 6 parts to the series right now, it will begin again in late &amp;#039;08. I didn&amp;#039;t see a torrent with all of them anywhere on the site yet, so I made this one. And of course, credit goes to the original scanners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4bd88f988e965ab221aea744152f0edddef51f1","amp;dn":"NewUniversal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4bd88f988e965ab221aea744152f0edddef51f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,189,136,249,136,233,101,171,34,26,234,116,65,82,240,237,221,239,81,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
