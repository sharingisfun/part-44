Not only do these changes include commercially available astronomical telescopes and software, but also what we know and understand about the universe. There are many new photographs and illustrations. Packs a great deal of valuable information into appendices which make up almost half the book. These are hugely comprehensive and provide hints and tips, as well as data (year 2000 onwards) for pretty well every aspect of amateur astronomy. This is probably the only book in which all this information is collected in one place.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 306 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 12th ed. edition (October 11, 2005)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1852338784\n# ISBN-13: 978-1852338787","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8762e31be2a5b7284fb68cbe3a2dce67dc326eb8","amp;dn":"The+Amateur+Astronomer%2C12th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8762e31be2a5b7284fb68cbe3a2dce67dc326eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,98,227,27,226,165,183,40,79,182,140,190,58,45,206,103,220,50,110,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
