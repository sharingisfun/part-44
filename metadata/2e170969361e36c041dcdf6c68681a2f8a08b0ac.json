I am posting 5 torrents - one for each year.\n\nPlease note:  Since Peabody and his boy Sherman were incorporated in the RB show, I have cut out just their segments - each program runs for about 5 minutes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e170969361e36c041dcdf6c68681a2f8a08b0ac","amp;dn":"Mr.+Peabody+and+Sherman+-+Season+2+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e170969361e36c041dcdf6c68681a2f8a08b0ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,23,9,105,54,30,54,192,65,220,223,108,104,104,26,47,138,8,176,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
