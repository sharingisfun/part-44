All in all, this set is a great way to sample the band's trademark melange of blues, folk, Yes-style riffs, and endearingly cosmic lyrics, not to mention the tag team guitars of Andy Powell and Ted Turner.\n\nHighlights include the epic &quot;Phoenix,&quot; a psychedelic jam that clocks in at over 10 minutes. There's also an impressively arranged live version of the Jimmy Reed blues classic &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do&quot; (misidentified for some reason as the Everly Brothers' &quot;You Got Me Runnin'&quot;), and &quot;Vas Dis,&quot; an uptempo shuffle originally by jazz organist Brother Jack McDuff which gives bassist Martin Turner (no relation) the chance to do some very impressive scat singing.\n\nIncludes liner notes by Todd Everett.\n\nTIME WAS: THE WISHBONE ASH COLLECTION includes photos from Andy Powell's collection.\n\nPersonnel: Ted Turner (vocals, guitar, steel guitar); Andy Powell (vocals, guitar); Martin Turner (vocals, bass guitar); Laurie Weisfield (guitar); Steve Upton (drums).\n\nWishbone Ash: Andy Powell, Ted Turner, Laurie Wisefield (vocals, guitar); Martin Turner (vocals, bass); John Wetton (bass); Steve Upton (drums); Claire Hamill (background vocals).\n\nAdditional personnel: Nelson &quot;Flaco&quot; Padron (congas).\n\nLabel\tMCA\nOrig Year\t1993\n\nDiscs\t2\nRelease Date\tApr 27, 1993\nStudio/Live\tMixed\nMono/Stereo\tStereo\nProducer\tDerek Lawrence; John Sherry; Howard Albert; Martin Turner; Nigel Gray; Ron Albert; Ted Turner; Bill Szymcyzk; Andy McKaie (Compilation)\nRecording Time\t146 minutes\nPersonnel\tJohn Wetton - bass\nMartin Turner - vocals, bass\nSteve Upton - drums\nAndy Powell - vocals, guitar\nLaurie Wisefield - vocals, guitar\nTed Turner - vocals, guitar, steel guitar\nClaire Hamill - background vocals\nLaurie Weisfield - guitar\n\n\nTRACK LISTING:\n\nCD1:\n1\tPhoenix\n2\tBlind Eye\n3\tErrors of My Way\n4\tHandy\n5\tVas Dis\n6\tLullaby\n7\tWhere Were You Tomorrow\n8\tPilgrim\n9\tBlowin' Free\n10\tTime Was\n\nCD2:\n1\tWarrior\n2\tSometime World\n3\tKing Will Come\n4\tSo Many Things To Say\n5\tBallad of the Beacon\n6\tSorrel\n7\tBaby, What You Want Me to Do\n8\tF.U.B.B\n9\tFront Page News\n10\t714\n11\tYou See Red\n12\tPay the Price\n13\tUnderground\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2002a3273dd5b6d93f6ce7090e310ddff288b766","amp;dn":"Wishbone+Ash+-+Time+Was-+The+Wishbone+Ash+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2002a3273dd5b6d93f6ce7090e310ddff288b766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,2,163,39,61,213,182,217,63,108,231,9,14,49,13,223,242,136,183,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
