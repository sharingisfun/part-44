Drag one or more unwanted apps onto AppZapper and watch as it finds all the extra files and lets you delete them with a single click. A slick safety system remembers which apps you want to keep safe, and the log tracks all the files you've zapped. Put simply, AppZapper is the uninstaller Apple forgot.\n\nThis contains the application downloaded from the developer's website + a serial from Serial Box.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9976bed1133a5f2aabc0047faf8d32706e9b9c1","amp;dn":"AppZapper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9976bed1133a5f2aabc0047faf8d32706e9b9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,151,107,237,17,51,165,242,170,188,0,71,250,248,211,39,6,233,185,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
