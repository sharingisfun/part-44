The album included other gems such as the beautiful &quot;Ukiah&quot;, &quot;South City Midnight Lady&quot;, &quot;Clear As The Driven Snow&quot;, &quot;Natural Thing&quot; and &quot;Evil Woman&quot;. There was absolutely no filler on this album it was that good. The band's sophmore effort &quot;Toulouse Street&quot; released a year earlier was good but &quot;The Captain And Me&quot; far surpassed that in terms of songwriting and musicianship. The Doobie Brothers would continue well into the seventies to release albums going thru various personel changes (Michael McDonald's induction into the band certainly changed their sound to a more jazz rock fm radio friendly sound). If there's one Doobie Brothers album you buy this should be the one.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Natural thing                                        [03:20]\n02.Long train runnin'                                   [03:28]\n03.China grove                                          [03:18]\n04.Dark eyed cajun woman                                [04:14]\n05.Clear as the driven snow                             [05:19]\n06.Without you                                          [05:02]\n07.South city midnight lady                             [05:29]\n08.Evil woman                                           [03:20]\n09.Busted down around o'connelly corners                [00:49]\n10.Ukiah                                                [03:02]\n11.The captain and me                                   [04:49]\n________\n42:10 min\n 65,2 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
