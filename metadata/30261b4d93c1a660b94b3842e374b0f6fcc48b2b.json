Thursday, the daughter of a formerly chart-topping political rapper, wants to stop being a serial one-month stander, and settle down into a stable life with a stable boyfriend. Risa, a skinny and audacious electronica punk rocker, wants to finally land an album deal, which she feels is the only way to win back the heart of her on-again of off-again closeted girlfriend. And after getting fired as the spokesmodel for her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hair company, sweet and gorgeous Tammy wants to prove that she has what it takes to make it on her own.\n\nNone of these women get what they want, but over the course of two years, they get exactly what they need.
