But modern legal scholarship has paid little attention to the actual juridical discourse of ancient Greece. This book rectifies that neglect through an analysis of the courtroom speeches from classical Athens, texts situated precisely at the intersection between law and literature. Reading these texts for their subtle literary qualities and their sophisticated legal philosophy, it proposes that in Athens' juridical discourse literary form and legal matter are inseparable. Through its distinctive focus on the literary form of Athenian forensic oratory, Law's Cosmos aims to shed new light on its juridical thought, and thus to change the way classicists read forensic oratory and legal historians view Athenian law.\nBook Description\nThe courtroom speeches of classical Athens created a new legal world and worldview. Law's Cosmos analyzes this jurisprudential world, exploring its boundaries and how it maintains them, its sources of authority and uses of violence, its diverse inhabitants, and its relation to the past and future.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 376 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (February 8, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521110742\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521110747","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592ec76c63bdc29bca9609b1c688152eb6975355","amp;dn":"Law%5C%27s+Cosmos%3A+Juridical+Discourse+in+Athenian+Forensic+Oratory+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592ec76c63bdc29bca9609b1c688152eb6975355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,46,199,108,99,189,194,155,202,150,9,177,198,136,21,46,182,151,83,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
