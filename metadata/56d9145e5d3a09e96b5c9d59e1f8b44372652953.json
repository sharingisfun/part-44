A high school dropout, Wright turned to drug dealing to support himself, and eventually used the profits to start his own rap label, Ruthless Records, with partner and music-business veteran Jerry Heller. E discovered a major performing talent in the D.O.C., and recruited Ice Cube and Dr. Dre to write songs for his stable of artists. When their composition &quot;Boyz-N-the Hood&quot; was rejected by Ruthless signee HBO, Cube, Dre, and E formed the first version of N.W.A. to record it themselves. Their first album, N.W.A. and the Posse, was released in 1987 and largely ignored; after a few tweaks of the lineup and the rough-edged subject matter, 1988's Straight Outta Compton made N.W.A. into superstars. E seized the opportunity to release a solo project later in the year, titled Eazy-Duz-It, which would be the only full-length album he would complete; it would sell well over two-million copies. \n\n\nGenre................: Rap\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Priority/Ruthless\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Boyz-N-The-Hood (Remix)\n02.8 Ball (Remix)\n03.Eazy-Duz-It\n04.Eazy-Er Said Than Dunn\n05.No More's\n06.We Want Eazy\n07.Nobody Move\n08.Radio\n09.Only If You Want It\n10.Neighborhood Sniper\n11.I'd Rather Fuck You\n12.Automobile\n13.Zaggin My Height Don't Fight\n14.Eazy Street\n15.Real Muthafuckin' G's\n16.Ole School Shit\n17.A Lil' Eazier Said\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d9145e5d3a09e96b5c9d59e1f8b44372652953","amp;dn":"Eazy-E+-+Eternal+E+%28Gangsta+Memorial+Edition%29+%281995%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d9145e5d3a09e96b5c9d59e1f8b44372652953","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,217,20,94,93,58,9,233,107,92,157,89,225,248,180,67,114,101,41,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
