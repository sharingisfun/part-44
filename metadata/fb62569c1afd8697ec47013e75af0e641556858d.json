BioWare describes Dragon Age: Origins as a &quot;dark heroic fantasy set in a unique world&quot;, and a spiritual successor to their Baldur's Gate series of games, which took place in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise.\n\n\n\nDragon Age: Origins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Awakening is an expansion for the fantasy role-playing video game Dragon Age: Origins. Awakening adds a brand new campaign which takes place during the aftermath of Dragon Age: Origins. The game also features new class specialization and skills for the player to develop.\n\nUpdated to v1.04 so all DLC is proper decrypt.\n\nIncluded All DLC\nReturn to Ostagar v1.1\nThe Stone Prisoner\nWarden's Keep\nMemory Band\nFeral Wolf Charm\nGuildmaster's Belt\nBand of Fire\nDalish Promise Ring\nCollector's Edition Items\nThe Edge\nEmbri's Many Pockets\nHelm of the Deep\nThe Lucky Stone\nThe Lion's Paw\nBlood Dragon Armor v1.0 &amp; v1.1 (v1.1 is in disc 3)\nMark of Vigilance\nAmulet of the War Mage\nThe Wicked Oath\nBulwark of the True King for Origins\nBulwark of the True King for Awakening\nPearl of the Anointed for Origins\nPearl of the Anointed for Awakening\nBregan's Bow for Origins\nBregan's Bow for Awakening\nFeastday Gifts\nFeastday Pranks\nThe Darkspawn Chronicles\nLeliana's Song\nGolems of Amgarrak\nWitch Hunt v1.1\n\nNOTE: I would recommend using the Blood Dragon Armor v1.0 instead of v1.1. The v1.1 has reduced stats and is only good for fixing a glitch when playing a Female Elf character. If you wish to use v1.1, the appropriate DAZIP is located in disc 3.\n\nBONUS: Dragon.Age.Origins.Prima.Official.Game.Guide included in disc 3\n\nMount, Install &amp; PLAY!
