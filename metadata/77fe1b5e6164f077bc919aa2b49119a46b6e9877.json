It was to be the second of the Star Fox series and the direct sequel to Star Fox. Both Argonaut Games and Nintendo developed the game, with Nintendo planning to publish it. The Japanese version was completely finished except for minor debugging tools that weren't yet removed. Development never matured past the original Japanese game until online modders got hold of a commercial ROM of the game and created a patch that not only emulated what the finished product would look like, but is also translated into English.\n\nStar Fox 2 continues the battle against Emperor Andross who seeks to conquer the Lylat system. The Star Fox team consisting of Fox, Falco, Slippy, Peppy and new members Miyu and Fay assembled once again to defeat him. The game introduces a new semi-real time game play system, featuring new ship types and two new Star Fox team members. It also features a more advanced 3D game engine thanks to a new improved version of the Super FX chip. Many see Star Fox Command as a spiritual successor, borrowing several of its innovative elements.\n\nThe game was never released due to the impending release of the Nintendo 64 and the desire to use the most advanced system available for a new Star Fox game.\n\n(information source: http://starfox.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Fox_2)\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nPatch information: http://agtp.romhack.net/project.php?id=starfox2\nI highly recommend the ZSNES emulator, which can be found here: http://www.zsnes.com/index.php?page=files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fe1b5e6164f077bc919aa2b49119a46b6e9877","amp;dn":"Star+Fox+2+%5BOriginal+%2B+Patch%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fe1b5e6164f077bc919aa2b49119a46b6e9877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,254,27,94,97,100,240,119,188,145,154,162,180,145,25,164,107,110,152,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
