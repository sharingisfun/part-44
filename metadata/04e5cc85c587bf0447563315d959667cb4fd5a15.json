Harland\nPraxis | October 2006 | ISBN-10: 0387341765 | PDF | 380 pages | 72.9 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-First-Men-Moon-Exploration/dp/0387341765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-First-Men-Moon-Exploration/dp/0387341765&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis book tells the story of Apollo 11 and dispels the myth that NASA faked the moon landings. The story is brought to life by exploiting the flight plan, mission report, in-flight transcripts (including conversations among the crew in the spacecraft that were not transmitted) and post-flight debriefing. It features scans recently produced by NASA of the original Hasselblad film. The final chapters discuss what was learned of the moon rocks, and reviews the follow-on missions. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive expertise and knowledge of the Moon landings shines through and seamlessly unites the myriad details of the mission.\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid M. Harland lives in Glasgow in Scotland. He holds a bachelor's degree in astronomy and a doctorate in computer science, both from St Andrews, the oldest university in Scotland, which is located on the end of a peninsula and thinks it lies at the centre of the universe. After working in academia and the computer industry, he &quot;retired&quot; in 1995 to write full time on his childhood interest in space exploration. He has published several dozen books, mostly with Springer-Praxis. He has also edited books by other authors. On a personal level, he has a fondness for cats, so long as they don't scratch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e5cc85c587bf0447563315d959667cb4fd5a15","amp;dn":"The+First+Men+on+the+Moon+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e5cc85c587bf0447563315d959667cb4fd5a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,229,204,133,197,135,191,4,71,86,51,21,217,89,102,124,180,253,90,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
