After meeting one another in a 12 step program, Mike and Annie fell in love and into a drug relapse that forced Annie to squander her promising up-and-coming art career and Mike to give up his relationship with his 3 year-old son. Their only chance at regaining their lives is through a dual intervention performed by Kristina and a treatment plan that aims to separate them.
