The client is completely free of advertisements and has a nice, easy to use interface. Firewall and router support is integrated and it is easy and convenient to use functionality like multi-hub connections, auto-connections and resuming of downloads.\n\n\nFirst time user?\n\nDC++ is a highly ranked piece of software among the projects hosted at Sourceforge. With more than fifty million downloads, new users continue to find benefits from the software every day.\n\n\nOverview\n\nDC++ is a client for the Direct Connect file sharing network.\nThe Direct Connect network is a decentralized network, made up of individual servers (hubs) that users join to share files with other members on that hub.\nEach hub is individually run by a fellow user of the Direct Connect network, and may have certain themes to the content on the hub.\nHub owners set up rules to regulate their hub as they see fit.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nDC++ is, based on observable factors, the most prevalent client on the Direct Connect network. Below are some of its features:\n\n\n* No ads, spyware, or bundled software that you don't need\n\n* Open source software, code freely available under the GNU GPL\n\n* Joins multiple hubs at the same time\n\n* List of bookmark-like favorite hubs and users\n\n* Shares large files and many files per your organization scheme\n\n* Tiger Tree Hashes (TTH) used for file integrity\n\n* Search across all (or selected) connected hub by type, size, or name\n\n* Resume of downloads, with optional search for alternate sources\n\n* Logging options and configuration for chat, private messages, downloads, and uploads\n\n* Autoconfiguration of UPnP routers\n\n* MAGNET link support for linking to specific content\n\n* Automatic and manual download priorities\n\n* Saving of user's file lists for browsing and queueing\n\n* Translation into other languags by custom supplied gettext po language files\n\n* Segmented downloading\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nGUI changes\n\n* By popular demand, a possibility added to unmerge search results for same files. In other words this means that in certain situations when merged results arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t an advantage, you have the option to organize your search results the same way as before.\n\n* User interface elements are automatically resized according to the length of the text they hold. It results not just nicely arranged controls; from now, all longer GUI translations will fit so thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no need to use ugly abbreviations anymore.  (To all translators: its time to review your GUI translations! :) )\n\n\nFixed bugs :\n\n* Fixed compatibility (non-segmented) mode downloads so they always resume correclty if you restart DC++. Also fixed a problem that in some cases DC++ still used chunks in this mode.\n\n* Fixed a possible crash when two or more shared directories have the same virtual name. This bug could hit those who have very large number of files shared (total share over 1 TiB).\n\n* Fixed error handling when file lists and zlib transfers are decompressed.\nThis could cause crash in special cases.\n\n* No more crashes when you remove several hundreds of elements from the finished transfersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lists.\n\n\nImprovements :\n\n* A possibility added to recheck integrity of partially downloaded files.\nThis is useful in case of any disk error,  but the main advantage it brings is the ablility to easily resume large unfinished downloads when your download queue lost or damaged.\n\n* From now DC++ optionally uses the user profile folder for default download target and also for storing settings and temporary files (hublists cache, file lists, etcÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦).  This feture will be most welcomed by Vista and Windows 7 users as it should eliminate UAC warnings in most cases. If you use the installer to install DC++, it will be configured to use profile folders.\nIf installed from the .zip archive manually, settings and downloads will be placed the old way (to the program folder).\n\n* Translating DC++ Help file to several languages are progressed a lot\n\n\nThe client can be downloaded, precompiled and ready to run.\nDC++ only runs on Windows NT based operating systems such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP.\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nHere is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for DC++:\nhttp://www.dslreports.com/faq/dc/\nDC++ should also work in Windows 7 :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2852f0c7817b909649864ff31101e5dd428efc2f","amp;dn":"DC%2B%2B+0.75","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2852f0c7817b909649864ff31101e5dd428efc2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,82,240,199,129,123,144,150,73,134,79,243,17,1,229,221,66,142,252,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
