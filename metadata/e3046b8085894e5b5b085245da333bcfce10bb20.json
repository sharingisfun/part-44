OMD was just WOW great. We laughed, danced and yelled like teenagers once again. Listening to their songs, I told myself all night that our generation was so lucky to have experienced this awesomeness. Short wave radio, vinylÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pops and cracks, MTV and endless number of talented but unlucky bands you hardly could keep track of. The concert got me so pumped that today I finished Vol 54 of these popular compilations I had been sitting on for some time. Alright,  letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enjoy the 80s now!\n\nTracklisting\n\n01 Makaton Chat - Federal State Chance  \n02 Vanity Fair - Lips Are Silent\n03 Another Day - Afraid Of Heights \n04 Rockets - Wrong Place, Right Time\n05 Beyond Words - On the Moon\n06 Lyon in Winter - The Haunting Moon\n07 Short Romans - Radio\n08 Face To Face - Tell Me Why\n09 Faded Films - Jack in the Box\n10 Clever Lines - After the Snow Melts\n11 Seven - Stranger Than Fiction\n12 Information - Inside Your Mind\n13 Mission - When Thunder Comes\n14 New Johnny 5 - Barbed Wire\n15 Edge Of The Wedge - She Loves By #s\n16 X-Spand-X - Sight\n17 DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Arcy - The Letter\n18 Tools of Romance - Cool Heart\n19 The Group - Technology \n20 I Spy - Channels\n21 Second Thoughts - Never Seen\n22 Ack Ack - Look The Other Way\n23 Edwards Voice - Falling From Another High Building\n24 Immunity - Strange Days\n25 Artiphax - Mystery Eyes\n26 Kevin Zed - Somewhere Else\n27 Never Say Never - My Own Thought\n28 Head of The Class - Numbers\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3046b8085894e5b5b085245da333bcfce10bb20","amp;dn":"Rare+Hits+of+The+80s+Vol.+54","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3046b8085894e5b5b085245da333bcfce10bb20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,4,107,128,133,137,78,91,91,8,82,69,218,51,59,207,206,16,187,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
