The song was a worldwide hit, reaching number two in the United Kingdom in 1989. The song was also a landmark release for the Belgian EBM- and New Beat-influenced house music. It was able to tackle the tough American market and became the first house song to break into mainstream. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was later certified triple platinum.\n\nTechnotronic is a Belgian studio-based music project formed by Jo Bogaert (A pseudonym of Thomas DeQuincey, born 1954, Aalst, Belgium) in 1988, who had already made his musical mark in the beginning of the 1980s as a part of a cover band and as a solo artist under various New beat projects, including The Acts of Madmen and Nux Nemo. Together with the actual vocalist Ya Kid K, he produced this hit single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; which was originally an instrumental. An image for the act was later put together utilizing Congolese-born fashion model Felly Kilingi as its album/single cover art and supposed singer in this music video.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_Up_the_Jam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_Up_the_Jam&lt;/a&gt;\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eABIlAaDj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eABIlAaDj&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8500kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:41\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
