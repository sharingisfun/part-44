So having 90% of the market in June means nothing, it's\nhow much you have at the end of the year that counts.  Your market share resets\nitself at the beginning of the year.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff8ec4a53601dbeb01c455fea901f1ee912f6bc","amp;dn":"%5BOS2+-+eComStation%5D+Entrepreneur+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ff8ec4a53601dbeb01c455fea901f1ee912f6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,248,236,74,83,96,29,190,176,28,69,95,234,144,31,30,233,18,246,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
