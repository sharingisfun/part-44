The rest of the songs are available on many other albums. If you want a full release of this vinyl just let me know and I'll upload it sometime in the future as I don't have much time these days.  Most of my recent torrents are recorded months ago.\n\n\nMore details in Rip info.txt file\n\nThis release includes a handful of pictures of the record. \n\nHope you like it. Enjoy!
