These are funny and poignant pieces, building a book that feels novelistic in sweep, yet true to the precision and direct aim of the short story. A real pleasure.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Antonya Nelson\n\nMothers and daughters ride the familial tide of joy, regret, loathing, and love in these stories of resilient and flawed women. In a battle between a teenage daughter and her mother, wheat bread and plain yogurt become weapons. An aimless college student, married to her much older professor, sneaks cigarettes while caring for their newborn son. On the eve of her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiftieth birthday, a pilfered fifth of rum, an unexpected tattoo, and rogue teenagers leave a woman questioning her place. And in a suite of stories, we follow capricious, ambitious single mother Ruby and her cautious, steadfast daughter Nora through their tumultuous lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€stray men, stray cats, and psychedelic drugsÃ¢â‚¬â€in 1970s California.\n\nGimlet-eyed and emotionally generous, achingly real and beautifully written, these unforgettable stories lay bare the connection and conflict in families. Shout Her Lovely Name heralds the arrival of a powerful new writer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf6d6a7c70e51f020493f1e6dde904c2133f34d","amp;dn":"Shout+Her+Lovely+Name+-+Natalie+Serber.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf6d6a7c70e51f020493f1e6dde904c2133f34d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,246,214,167,199,14,81,240,32,73,63,30,109,222,144,76,33,51,243,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
