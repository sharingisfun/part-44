For most\nartists, losing that much material would have been a creatively scarring and\ndemoralizing experience. For Greg, it was just an excuse to turn inward once\nagain, and write more songs. Of the songs that came to comprise his 24th album\nFreak Flag, the title track is all that remains of that ill-fated lost original\nalbum. Greg wrote ten new songs, moving on to record them at Memphis,\nTennessee's legendary Ardent Studios. This time there were no storms, but\ncreative lightning did strike again, resulting in what many have called Greg's\nbest album. Like a jagged stone worked by ocean waves, Brown's signature rough\nhewn-yet-velvet-smooth baritone is in fine form on Freak Flag. Produced by Bo\nRamsey, the album also includes a cover of Brown's wife Iris Dement's &quot;Let the\nMystery Be&quot; and Brown's daughter Pieta's song &quot;Remember the Sun.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5eff44daf3757f9a75ea158d002f00cc772dd8c","amp;dn":"Greg+Brown-Freak+Flag-2011-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5eff44daf3757f9a75ea158d002f00cc772dd8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,239,244,77,175,55,87,249,167,94,161,88,208,2,240,12,199,114,221,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
