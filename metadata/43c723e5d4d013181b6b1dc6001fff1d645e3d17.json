And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she gambled her life, trusting in dear God.\n\nThe curtain went up.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis is a little game called Penny Girl.  It is a very simple game.  Basically it's Russian Roulette but with lolis.\n\n\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\nPull the trigger with the left mouse button.\nRotate the cylinder by right-clicking.\n\nPull the trigger multiple times in a row, and you can get a bonus.\n(The greater the probability of hitting a bullet with each shot is 1/6, 1/5, 1/4...)\n\nBy turning the cylinder, and then reset to 1/6 the probability of hit by a bullet (but that also resents your bonus points per shot).\n\nRight-clicking twice will exit the game.  In this case, to update the score of the amount obtained.  If you die, your score will not be updated (so you have to choose when to quit, otherwise you risk loosing all the points you made that round.\n\nIf you die, you can try again by clicking the left.  If you right-click on the home screen, you will close the window.\n\n\n\nRANKING:\n\nIf you right-click on the title screen, you can submit your score to the online ranking (http://abaraya.main.jp/penny/penny_ranking.phppennygirl).\n\nNote: I'm not sure if this feature still works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c723e5d4d013181b6b1dc6001fff1d645e3d17","amp;dn":"Penny+Girl+v1.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c723e5d4d013181b6b1dc6001fff1d645e3d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,199,35,229,212,208,19,24,27,107,29,198,0,31,255,29,100,94,61,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
