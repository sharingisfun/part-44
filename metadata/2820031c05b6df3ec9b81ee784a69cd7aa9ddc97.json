Live drumming and rock guitars intertwine with cyborg drum machine beats, video game bleeps, soulful singing and rap choruses. Lyrically, Father Creeper embraces a deep sensitivity for a traumatized society where the turmoil is real, the optimism stubborn and the booty ripe. Father Creeper shows us a musician hitting his stride with the confidence and vision to craft songs as robust and challenging and attractive as life in our electrified, apocalyptic 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2820031c05b6df3ec9b81ee784a69cd7aa9ddc97","amp;dn":"Spoek+Mathambo+-+Father+Creeper+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2820031c05b6df3ec9b81ee784a69cd7aa9ddc97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,32,3,28,5,182,223,62,201,184,30,231,132,166,156,215,170,157,220,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
