Both John Norum and his replacement in 1986, Kee Marcello are excellent guitarists. Mic Michaeli does well with his keyboard work, and Tony Reno and Ian Haugland are some of the world's best drummers. John LevÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n is a skilful bassist.\n\nAs you've maybe noticed, SONY Music has released an &quot;updated&quot; version of this album, and it's been given the original name &quot;1982-2000&quot;... The only new things you'll find on it, are new front and back covers (the booklet inside is just like &quot;1982-1992&quot;), and yes, &quot;The Final Countdown 2000&quot;, a dance remix of the classic song. A new cover and a disappointing remix isn't really worth the extra money, so unless you're a die-hard EUROPE collector, take my advice: Buy this one instead. \n\nby Stein-Vidar Andersen\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - In The Future To Come.wma         \n02 - Seven Doors Hotel.wma                                  \n03 - Stormwind.wma                                          \n04 - Open Your Heart.wma                                    \n05 - Scream Of Anger.wma                                    \n06 - Dreamer.wma                                            \n07 - The Final Countdown.wma                                \n08 - On Broken Wings.wma                                    \n09 - Rock The Night.wma                                     \n10 - Carrie.wma                                             \n11 - Cherokee.wma                                           \n12 - Superstitious.wma                                      \n13 - Ready Or Not.wma                                       \n14 - Prisoners In Paradise (Single Edit).wma                \n15 - I'll Cry For You (Acoustic).wma                        \n16 - Sweet Love Child.wma                                   \n17 - Yesterday's News.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec67ca534e9b3ef412ec3a6d6b93d3c453509f4","amp;dn":"Europe+-+1982+-+1992+%281993%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec67ca534e9b3ef412ec3a6d6b93d3c453509f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,198,124,165,52,233,179,239,65,46,195,166,214,185,61,60,69,53,9,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
