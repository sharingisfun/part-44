Can a devout Muslim be a devout Muslim and drop the belief in the sacredness of the Rock? Can one right (the right of return) be given up for another (the right to live in peace)? Can one claim Palestinian identity and still retain Israeli citizenship? What is a Palestinian state worth? For over sixty years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been subjected to many solutions and offered many answers by diverse parties. Yet, answers are only as good as the questions that beget them. It is with this simple, but powerful idea, the idea of asking the basic questions anew, that the renowned Palestinian philosopher and activist Sari Nusseibeh begins his book. \n\nWhat Is a Palestinian State Worth? poses questions about the history, meaning, future, and resolution of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Deeply informed by political philosophy and based on decades of personal involvement with politics and social activism, NusseibehÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moderate voiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½global in its outlook, yet truly grounded in his native city of JerusalemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½points us toward a future which, as George Lamming once put it, is colonized by our acts in this moment, but which must always remain open. \n\nFebruary 2011\nPublisher: Harvard University Press\nFormat: Hardcover 256pp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f628e603b565ae0edfa642d5c04c2bddc19b2e3e","amp;dn":"What+is+a+Palestinian+State+Worth%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f628e603b565ae0edfa642d5c04c2bddc19b2e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,40,230,3,181,101,174,14,223,166,66,213,192,76,43,221,193,155,46,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
