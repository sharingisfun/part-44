A natural reaction to that news might be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh, are they still making Dogme films, then?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but director Olesen proves that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life in the old Dogme yet, as In Your Hands is a powerful, engaging drama that benefits greatly from OlesenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s naturalistic approach.\n\nPowerful Well Made Drama\n\nThe characters are extremely well drawn and you really feel for both Kate and Anna, despite a gnawing feeling that the film is unlikely to have a happy ending.\n\nThe acting is equally impressive - Trine Dyrholm is terrific as Kate and we find ourselves as drawn to her as the other characters are, constantly asking ourselves if sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really going to turn out to be a miracle worker. Jorgensen is superb as Anna, brilliantly conveying AnnaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s internal struggle between her faith, her sense of rationality and her hope.\n\nThe script is intelligent and thought-provoking, with the psychology of each character carefully worked out. In addition, the naturalistic direction often makes it feel as if weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re watching a documentary, which gives the drama an extra emotional edge.\n\nIn short, In Your Hands is a powerful, well made drama with superb performances throughout. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unusual to see issues of faith and religious belief dealt with so engagingly on screen and OlesenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s direction ensures that your attention is held from the start.
