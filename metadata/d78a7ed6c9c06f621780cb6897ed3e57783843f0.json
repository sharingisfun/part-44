The suspect claims he is a pawn in a huge labyrinth of lies and deception - can he be believed? \n\nThe case is immediately handed over to the FBI, but this time they're forced to ask for outside help. Ex-criminal behaviour psychologist and lead Detective with the Ultra Violent Crime Unit of the LAPD, Robert Hunter, is asked to run a series of interviews with the apprehended man. These interviews begin to reveal terrifying secrets that no one could've foreseen, including the real identity of a killer so elusive that no one, not even the FBI, had any idea he existed ... until now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d78a7ed6c9c06f621780cb6897ed3e57783843f0","amp;dn":"An+Evil+Mind+-+Chris+Carter+%28Robert+Hunter+6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d78a7ed6c9c06f621780cb6897ed3e57783843f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,138,126,214,201,192,111,98,23,128,203,104,151,237,62,87,120,56,67,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
