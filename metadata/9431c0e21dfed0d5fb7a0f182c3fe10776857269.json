Observing\neach individual meerkat go about their daily business\nof survival, against the magnificent backdrop of the\nSouthern Kalahari, has made it impossible for us not\nproject our human attitudes and emotions onto each of\nthese little yet, larger than life, characters.\nHere follows a brief description of some of the\nten meerkats that make up the Gosa gang based\non our observations thus far.\n\nMeet the Gosa Meerkat Gang.\n\nCleopatra\nThe alpha female of the Gosa gang, she is a serene presence.\nFrom the start, she has been totally unfazed by the presence\nof the crew and our gear. Her calm demeanour seems to have\nrubbed off on most of the other members, enabling us to gain\ntheir trust and film them without interrupting their natural\nactivities. Sadly, and quite surprisingly, she has been\nunable to rear any pups, and it is now clear that her most\nrecent litter also succumbed. Whether she is a strong enough\ncharacter to maintain her status as the alpha female and hold\nthe gang together remains to be seen. Big challenges lie ahead\nfor Cleo.\nGandalf\nRegally grey in the hair around his face, his status as the\nalpha male remains undisputed at this point. He is something\nof a workaholic, and takes his job as head of security very\nseriously indeed. He is inevitably the one who takes on the\nresponsibility of sentry duty, risking life and limb to get\nas high as possible to scan for both aerial and ground predators.\nHis motto: Ã¢â‚¬Å“No tree too high, no bush too thorny.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nHow he manages to eat enough in between performing his duties,\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not quite sure, but he still seems to be in pretty good shape.\nDelilah\nAn extremely nervous, bordering on paranoiac, beta female, she\nseems quite distant from the alpha pair. Her slightly larger\nthan usual belly suggests that, she has either been enjoying\nthe beetle larvae buffet a little too much, or she has broken\nthe meerkat gang code and gotten herself pregnant. I suspect\nit to be the latter, which could signal serious trouble for\nher and the pups down the line.\nDingaan\nA prominent beta male in the gang, he is GandalfÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right\nhandÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.umÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..meerkat. Equally adept at scaling impossibly\nhigh and flimsy sentry posts, he performs sentry duty when\nGandalf allows himself a breather and a chance to protein-load.\nHe has exceptional eyesight, but seems to lack a little bit of\njudgement as he has often sounded the alarm for something quite\ninnocuous. It seems that the rest of the gang have mastered\nthe art of knowing when he is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcrying wolfÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. He is a strong\nand good-looking meerkat, and no doubt he will have designs on\nbecoming an alpha male someday. Whether he will have the\ngumption to challenge Gandalf, or whether he will choose to\nseek greener pastures, only time will tell.\nBrutus and Napoleon\nTwo beta males that, as with Delilah, are not part of the\ninner circle of the Gosa gang and that we donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know much\nabout. We have often noticed them sneaking off, quite\nrapidly mind you, from the burrow in the early morning,\nresulting in a split in the gang for the dayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s foraging.\nThey do not always spend the night in the same burrow as\nthe rest of the gang either. It is possible, even likely,\nthat one of them is responsible for impregnating Delilah.\nIt will be very interesting to see how it all plays out\nshould those pups arrive.\nStarsky\nThe youngest member of the gang, he is a real character;\nfull of life, extremely curious and rather mischievous.\nFrom the start he has shown a keen interest in us and our\nvarious accessories. He seems to have a thing for the old\naqua show curtain and always quite fancies the look of his\nreflection in the camera housing. Despite the fact that\nhe is quite old enough and perfectly capable of finding\nhis own food, he has somehow managed to convince a few of\nthe others to hand over their hard-earned grubs every once\nin a while. He has also recently discovered the power of\nhis anal gland, which is used for scent marking, and has\nbeen marking anything he can lift his leg up to, including\nthe other gang members. The smart money says he will be\nthe first to perform this display of ownership on the\ncamera rig or one of the crew. Indeed, it seems that there\nare great things written in his stars.\nHutch\nOlder than Starsky, but not quite at full maturity, he has\ndisplayed a level-headedness beyond his years and is a born\nleader. He has not been shy to perform sentry duty when\nthe other older males have not been around and his\ntree-climbing skills are on the up and up. Never shy to\nlet his hair down, he is also StarskyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sparring partner\nwhen itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time for fun and games at the burrow. He has,\nhowever, also made it clear that he is higher up the chain\nof command than Starsky and the two younger females, and\nhas never hesitated to put any of them in their place should\nthey ever get a little too cheeky.\n\n\n\n\n\nORiGiNAL SOURCE: BluRay.DTS.x264-DON &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/852*480/23fps\nAudio: AAC/6ch/320Kbps\nFile Size: 500MB x3\nSample Included: Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9431c0e21dfed0d5fb7a0f182c3fe10776857269","amp;dn":"The.Meerkat.Gang.Wild.Adventure.In.The.Kalahari.Desert.%5B2013%5D480","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9431c0e21dfed0d5fb7a0f182c3fe10776857269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,49,192,226,29,254,208,213,251,122,15,24,44,63,225,7,118,133,114,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
