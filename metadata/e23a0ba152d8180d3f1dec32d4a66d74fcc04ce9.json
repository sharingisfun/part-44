Recorded at City Auditorium in Colorado Springs, CO on October 20th, 1998, with the 6 original members; John Bell, John Hermann, Michael Houser, Todd Nance, Domingo Ortiz, and David Schools. \nSince 1990, Widespread Panic and its fans have created a magical stage in Colorado doing what they do in all sorts of venues, locations, seasons and circumstances. From early-on true holes-in-the-wall to setting sell-out records at perhaps the greatest outdoor venue on Earth in Red RocksÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..from dust-infested fields to the purple mountain majesties themselvesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..from a continual celebration of life to the celebration of a life in June and August of 2002. There is no doubt the down home comfort afforded by ColoradoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal and physical environs create a outlet for Widespread Panic to fully plug intoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦for the moment and foreverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. and truly let the music play.\n\nAbout a decade and 80 Colorado performances later, one of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“expect the unexpectedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows came to us Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t during a Red Rocks run or from some small, intimate venue during the legendary Sit &amp; Ski Tour or even at the base of some beautiful mountainÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.as one might expectÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..but rather from a somewhat random Tuesday night in the fall of 1998Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.at the City Auditorium in Colorado Springs. Totally on top of their game at the time, the band staged a performance that really dug deep into the Colorado mystique.\n\n--------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23a0ba152d8180d3f1dec32d4a66d74fcc04ce9","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1998-10-20+-+City+Aud+in+Colorado+Springs%2C+CO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23a0ba152d8180d3f1dec32d4a66d74fcc04ce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,58,11,161,82,216,24,13,63,29,236,50,212,166,109,116,252,192,76,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
