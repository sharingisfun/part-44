Dont like it?  Dont download it. Dont complain. Dont get in the way.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE - \n\nFIRST READ INTRO, \n\nTHEN CHAPTERS 11 AND 12, THE LAST 2.  \n\nTHIS IS WHAT TOLSTOY RECOMMENDS.\n\nThis book was taken by Gandhi upon leaving law school in England, as his Bible to his nonviolence work in South Africa, and to his first ashram - THE TOLSTOY FARM.\n\nThe root work for this book is The Gospel in Brief, reflecting Tolstoys reading of the original Greek Gospel texts, an effort that averted his planned suicide, and became the basis of his next 40 years work, having completed all his famous novels.\n\nFor Gandhi, the pinnacle of what it meant to be Human was the man Jesus.  For Gandhi, the greatest example in his time, was Leo Tolstoy, after reading the Greek texts of Jesus.\n\nNeither Tolstoy, not Gandhi ever had the slightest interest in whether Jesus was the son of god, worked miracles, etc.  Their entire, and central, and lifelong interest was in his teachings about how to live, how to be a human being, how to make peace.\n\nIf we ignore what they learned, just a bit longer, all is finished. \n\nThe time is now, or never, to bring about a world with people living as we were designed to live.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e03de8b939e7dbc4b4ea2eb5d3bb22f6a1e9aa5f","amp;dn":"Gandhis+S.+Africa+Bible+-+Kingdom+of+God+is+Within+You+-+Tolstoy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e03de8b939e7dbc4b4ea2eb5d3bb22f6a1e9aa5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,61,232,185,57,231,219,196,180,234,46,181,211,187,34,246,161,233,170,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
