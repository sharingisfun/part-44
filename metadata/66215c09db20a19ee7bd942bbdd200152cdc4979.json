But no matter the style, EscovedoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs tend to default to a dreamy drone. Sometimes Escovedo plays loud, with wildly reverberating guitar and rattling drums; sometimes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more muted, sticking to the soft hum of a violin or cello over acoustic guitar. But Escovedo is a cool customer regardless, singing in his pleasantly raspy voice about a life spent on the road, watching people and places slip past him. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an effortlessness about EscovedoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs, such that listeners could easily miss that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing about desperate folks in desperate situationsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that sometimes the desperate person is Escovedo himself.\nEscovedoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 11th solo album, Big Station, is more deceptive than most. Working again with his recent songwriting collaborator Chuck Prophet and producer Tony Visconti, Escovedo has made his most consistently cheery-sounding album\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/27/alejandro-escovedo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/27/alejandro-escovedo/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66215c09db20a19ee7bd942bbdd200152cdc4979","amp;dn":"Alejandro+Escovedo...Big+Station%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66215c09db20a19ee7bd942bbdd200152cdc4979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,33,92,9,219,32,161,158,231,189,148,43,189,210,0,21,44,220,73,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
