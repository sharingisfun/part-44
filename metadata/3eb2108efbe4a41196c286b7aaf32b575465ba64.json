US President John F Kennedy is assassinated as his motorcade passes through the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streets. The assassin is soon captured, and revealed to be disaffected Communist sympathizer Lee Harvey Oswald. Did Oswald act alone, or did he have help? Is the Bilderberg Group simply a group of international financiers concerned with promoting democracy throughout the world, or is there a more sinister power at work? And what really happened to Princess DianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mercedes one warm August nigh in a Paris underpass?\n\nConspiracy looks at a range of the most interesting theories of this nature, from the risibly far-fetched, such as the belief that the world is run by the lizard people, to the only-too-true and tragic such as the overthrow and murder of Chilean President Salvador Allende.
