Her family robs banksÃ¢â‚¬â€even she and her twelve-year-old brother Tom are in on the act now. Sophia, NinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, keeps chasing the thrill: Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnyway, their moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insured!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ she says. \n\nAfter yet another move and another new school, Nina is fed up and wants things to change. This time sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a friend sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to keep: Spencer loves weird words and will talk to her about almost anything. His mother has just left home with a man who looks like a body-builder vampire, and his father and sister have stopped talking. \n\nSpencer and Nina both need each other as their families fall apart, but Nina is on the run and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if she will ever see Spencer again. Steph Bowe, author of Girl Saves Boy, once again explores the hearts and minds of teenagers in a novel full of drama, laughter and characters with strange and wonderful ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f81dee0cd9509d7a9499877cf8ee1603cdb7163","amp;dn":"All+This+Could+End+by+Steph+Bowe+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f81dee0cd9509d7a9499877cf8ee1603cdb7163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,129,222,224,205,149,9,215,169,73,152,119,207,142,225,96,60,219,113,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
