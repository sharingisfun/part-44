Do you want to really get the most out of Rails? The secret to using the Rails framework effectively is to learn the Ruby programming language. And here's the best part: Learning Ruby has benefits that go beyond Rails or even web programming. Ruby is a powerful tool in its own right. Take the time to learn Ruby now and it will continue to pay off down the road.\n\nYou can start learning Ruby today in this online training course! All of the topics and syntax in this course work seamlessly with Ruby 2.0 and 1.9.\n\n To build solid web apps (fast!), you need a good foundation.\n\nMost folks jump right into Rails. It's absolute bliss for the first few minutes it takes to stand up a web app. Then the real programming begins. If you're comfortable writing Ruby code, it's smooth sailing from thereÃ¢â‚¬â€you'll have sustained productivity throughout the project. But if you don't have a good grasp of the Ruby programming language, then you're in for a bumpy ride. You'll likely end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out why things don't work. You might even resort to copying in some Ruby code you found on the web. Unfortunately, even if it works, you won't understand why.\n\nLearn Ruby this week and you'll save a lot of time and frustration later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e3d8b23150121f7a9ea86302a4983bf8cbf36d3","amp;dn":"The+Pragmatic+Studio+-+Ruby+Training+Videos+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e3d8b23150121f7a9ea86302a4983bf8cbf36d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,61,139,35,21,1,33,247,169,234,134,48,42,73,131,191,140,191,54,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
