It describes a number of effective computer-aided methods for analysis of the nonlinear and nonstationary biomedical signals generated by complex physiological mechanics. This book also introduces several popular machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms for biomedical signal classifications. The book is well-suited for all researchers looking to better understand knee joint biomechanics and the advanced technology for vibration arthrometry.\r\n\r\nDr. Yunfeng Wu is an Associate Professor at the School of Information Science and Technology, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34df44350cc00349bc8a426655dce736245c4e0","amp;dn":"Knee+Joint+Vibroarthrographic+Signal+Processing+and+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f34df44350cc00349bc8a426655dce736245c4e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,77,244,67,80,204,0,52,155,200,164,38,101,93,206,115,98,69,196,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
