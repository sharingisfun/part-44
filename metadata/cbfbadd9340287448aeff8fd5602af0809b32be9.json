By the fourth beta version, Valve Software, the developer who created Half-Life, began assisting in the development of Counter-Strike.[1] In 2000, Valve bought the rights to Counter-Strike, and would publish the title for Microsoft Windows that year, and later in 2003 for the Xbox. OS X and Linux ports were available in January 2013.[2]\nThe game has been expanded into a series since its original release, which currently includes Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Counter-Strike pits a team of terrorists against a team of counter-terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force.\n\nCounter-Strike 1.6 Contains of : \n\n[#1] - New maps\n[#2] - Registered in SECTOR masterserver\n[#3] - You can play with bots ( also online with real players)\n[#4] - Protected from slowhack plugins on servers.\n[#5] - Fixed fugs of saving demo , also pictures (screenshots)\n[#6] - Done launcher options (of steam)\n\nFor Problems contact skype ID : m.pavilion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbfbadd9340287448aeff8fd5602af0809b32be9","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+1.6+%28CLEAN+VERSION%29+%5BV43%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbfbadd9340287448aeff8fd5602af0809b32be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,251,173,217,52,2,135,68,138,239,248,253,86,2,175,8,9,179,43,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
