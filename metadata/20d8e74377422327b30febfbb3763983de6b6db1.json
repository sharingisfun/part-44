Not only do these changes include commercially available astronomical telescopes and software, but also what we know and understand about the universe. There are many new photographs and illustrations. Writing in the easy-going style that made him famous as a writer and broadcaster, Sir Patrick introduced astronomy and amateur observing together, so that his reader gets an idea of what he is observing at the same time as how to observe. Almost half the book is Appendices. These are hugely comprehensive and provide hints and tips, as well as data for pretty well every aspect of amateur astronomy. This is probably the only book in which all this information is collected in one place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d8e74377422327b30febfbb3763983de6b6db1","amp;dn":"The+Amateur+Astronomer+%2812e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d8e74377422327b30febfbb3763983de6b6db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,216,231,67,119,66,35,39,179,15,235,251,179,118,57,131,222,107,109,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
