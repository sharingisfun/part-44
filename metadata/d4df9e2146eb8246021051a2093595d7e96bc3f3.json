With a tongue even sharper than the blade she deftly wields, she has all but mastered her devious trade - until she picks the pocket of a dashing American who wrests her from the sordid streets of London. In the arms of her gallant protector, she is helpless against the longing he elicits within her. Royce Manchester basks in a world of privilege and power in the decadent British Regency, and lowborn Morgana finds in him a love she's never known. But the secret of her true parentage threatens to bring her new life crashing down. With a sinister figure from her past ever lurking at her heels, she and Royce must confront one of Regency England's most diabolical villains - a challenge that fans the flame of a love that knows no bounds. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4df9e2146eb8246021051a2093595d7e96bc3f3","amp;dn":"Whisper+to+Me+of+Love+by+Shirlee+Busbee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4df9e2146eb8246021051a2093595d7e96bc3f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,223,158,33,70,235,130,70,2,16,81,162,9,53,149,215,233,107,195,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
