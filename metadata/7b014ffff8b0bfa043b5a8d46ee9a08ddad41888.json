Hashemian (Springer, 2006).pdf\n\nISBN 9783540337034\n\nThis book provides a training course for I and C maintenance engineers in power, process, chemical, and other industries. It summarizes all the scattered literature in this field. The book compiles 30 years of knowledge gained by the author and his staff in testing the I and C systems of nuclear power plants around the world. It focuses on process temperature and pressure sensors and the verification of these sensorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ calibration and response time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b014ffff8b0bfa043b5a8d46ee9a08ddad41888","amp;dn":"Maintenance+of+Process+Instrumentation+in+Nuclear+Power+Plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b014ffff8b0bfa043b5a8d46ee9a08ddad41888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,1,79,255,248,176,191,160,67,181,168,212,110,233,160,141,218,212,24,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
