She'd divorced him for cruelty and the detectives on \nthe case, Petra Connor and Stu Bishop, immediately elevate him to No 1 suspect.\n But a thorough investigation of the scene reveals that there was probably\n a witness to the killing. Reading the evidence on the ground Petra and Stu \nbelieve it is a homeless man, but in fact it is a homeless boy - Billy Straight.\n He knows he has vital evidence, but he is too scared of being returned to his\n former existence to come forward. As Billy battles with his conscience,\n Petra and Stu have plenty of other leads to follow and a dual narrative \nof stunning complexity and suspense develops until they eventually combine\n into a single crescendo of tension.\n Jonathan Kellerman has produced a thriller which is genuinely unputdownable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:737d01e681d4fd80fa8ee2c6c0b0b221cfa74a4f","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Kellerman-+Billy+Straight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"737d01e681d4fd80fa8ee2c6c0b0b221cfa74a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,125,1,230,129,212,253,128,250,142,226,198,192,176,178,33,207,167,74,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
