This was available as a 7.85 GB dual-layer ISO image and a few 700 MB options.  I don't think 700 MB is enough to store a two-hour movie at decent quality, especially not one as visual as Somewhere in Time, but 7.85 GB is way too much to make everyone download!\n\nSo I downloaded the 7.85 GB ISO image and deconstructed it.  This torrent contains the movie in a 1.5 GB AVI and all the extras in their own separate AVIs.\n\nExtras include a 1 hour &quot;Making of...&quot; featurette, a short about the movie's fan club 'Insite', and a two minute theatrical trailer.  There are also a couple of small AVIs that are full of production notes and still photos.  I can't find an AVI player that will let me frame-by-frame through them, but I will include them for the sake of completeness.\n\nThe feature has two stereo audio tracks, English and French.  I could only put two audio tracks into the AVI, so the director's commentary is included as a separate MP3 file.  If you start the MP3 and the movie at the same time, they should sync up perfectly.\n\nSubtitles in English and Spanish are included in external sub/idx files.\n\nThe total size of the torrent is 2.3 GB.  You can download it all or de-select the files you don't want in your torrent client.\n\n\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Somewhere_in_Time_1980.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.45 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 013 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nBit rate                         : 1 615 Kbps\nWidth                            : 736 pixels\nHeight                           : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.917\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.238\nStream size                      : 1.17 GiB (80%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.0.3 (UTC 2004-12-20)\n\nAudio #1\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 142 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\nAudio #2\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 43mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 142 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1988d39d10825b16635dbe9327053c66fa077538","amp;dn":"Somewhere+in+Time+%281980%29++DVD+deconstructed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1988d39d10825b16635dbe9327053c66fa077538","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,136,211,157,16,130,91,22,99,93,190,147,39,5,60,102,250,7,117,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
