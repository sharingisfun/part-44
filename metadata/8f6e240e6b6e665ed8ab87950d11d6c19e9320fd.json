The authors fully embrace the calculus reform movement in technology and pedagogy, while taking it a step further with a unique organization and applications to real-world problems.\n\nThe book aims to:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Develop calculus in the context of scientific and mathematical questions.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Treat systems of differential equations as fundamental objects of study.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Construct and analyze mathematical models.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Use the method of successive approximations to define and solve problems.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Develop geometric visualization with hand-drawn and computer graphics.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Give numerical methods a more central role.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Encourage collaborative work.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Empower students to use calculus as a language and a tool.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Make students comfortable tackling large, messy, ill-defined problems.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Foster an experimental attitude towards mathematics.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Help students appreciate the value of approximate solutions.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Develop the sense that understanding concepts arises out of working\non problems, not simply from reading the text and imitating its techniques.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6e240e6b6e665ed8ab87950d11d6c19e9320fd","amp;dn":"Calculus+in+Context+-+The+Five+College+Calculus+Course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6e240e6b6e665ed8ab87950d11d6c19e9320fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,110,36,14,107,110,102,94,216,171,135,149,13,17,214,193,158,147,32,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
