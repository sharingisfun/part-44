A platoon in Burma sings to keep its spirit up. Inspiration comes from their self-taught lute player, Mizushima. At war&amp;#039;s end, while they await repatriation at Mudon prison camp, Mizushima is sent to convince a Japanese company dug into a mountain that it must surrender. He fails, the British attack, many die, and his companions fear he&amp;#039;s been killed. However, he has survived and disguised himself as a Buddhist priest. En route to Mudon to join his comrades, the frequent sight of dead Japanese soldiers overwhelms him. He vows to live a life of prayer, burying bones and bodies; his friends want him to return with them to Japan.\n\nThe Criterion Collection edition.
