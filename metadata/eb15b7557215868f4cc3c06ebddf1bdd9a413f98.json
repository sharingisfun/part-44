I am a little nervous about trying to review such a unique example of a &quot;childrens&quot; television series. You know what I can't believe? That nobody else has yet gotten round to commemorating this ingenious creation by means of a review.\nWhat's going on, people?\nAnyway, let's get down to business here.\nThe essential quirky spark necessary to transform the show from a dull re-telling of classic fairy tales to ten minutes of condensed comedy (suitable for kids and still funny for... &quot;older&quot; kids) is provided by Mr. Mayall. His unique story-telling method ensures the audience sits entranced for the duration, and the highly imaginative animation techniques used to accompany his wacky talents don't do any harm either.\nIn other words, everyone should enrich their lives by watching this comic gem.\nSo do it. Do it now, before it's too late!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb15b7557215868f4cc3c06ebddf1bdd9a413f98","amp;dn":"Grim+Tales+-+S01E01+-+The+Three+Feathers.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb15b7557215868f4cc3c06ebddf1bdd9a413f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,21,183,85,114,21,134,143,76,195,192,110,189,223,27,221,154,65,63,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
