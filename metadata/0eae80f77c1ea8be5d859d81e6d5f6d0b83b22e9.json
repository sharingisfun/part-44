It is the new Live album by the legendary Rolling Stones. At the same time its the soundtrack for Martin Scorsese?s documentary, about the Stones. 2CD in high quality vbr mp3. ?The album features a selection of live favourites taken from the band?s huge catalogue of work.? I will check this one out for sure.\n\nThe Rolling Stones are an English band whose rhythm and blues and rock &amp; roll- based music became popular during the ?British Invasion? in the early 1960s. The band were formed in London in 1962 by original leader Brian Jones, but were eventually led by the songwriting partnership of singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards.
