The devastating \nstruggle to the death between the Carthaginians and the Romans was one \nof the defining dramas of the ancient world. In an epic series of land \nand sea battles, both sides came close to victory before the Carthaginians \nfinally succumbed and their capital city, history, and culture were \nalmost utterly erased.\n\nDrawing on a wealth of new archaeological research, Richard Miles vividly \nbrings to life this lost empire-from its origins among the Phoenician \nsettlements of Lebanon to its apotheosis as the greatest seapower in \nthe Mediterranean. And at the heart of the history of Carthage lies \nthe extraordinary figure of Hannibal-the scourge of Rome and one of \nthe greatest military leaders, but a man who also unwittingly led his \npeople to catastrophe. The first full-scale history of Carthage in decades, \nCarthage Must Be Destroyed reintroduces modern listeners to the larger-than-lif-\ne historical players and the ancient glory of this almost forgotten \ncivilization.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPirates, sharing is caring!
