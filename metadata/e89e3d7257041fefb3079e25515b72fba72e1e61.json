No surprise there: Webb co-created and produced Adam-12 as well (he also directed the first episode) and his sensibility--square, old-fashioned, low on frills-- imbues the 26 episodes included in this set.\n\nMartin Milner stars as Pete Malloy, a veteran cop whose new partner (following the death of the previous one) is Jim Reed (Kent McCord), a rookie who&amp;#039;s more than a little wet behind the ears. The show follows them as they make the rounds in their police black &amp; white, dealing with all manner of circumstances, from the mundane (traffic violations, petty domestic disputes, noise complaints) to the monstrous (murder, drugs, child abuse, suicide). Each about 25 minutes long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89e3d7257041fefb3079e25515b72fba72e1e61","amp;dn":"Adam-12+-+Season+One+%281968%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e89e3d7257041fefb3079e25515b72fba72e1e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,158,61,114,87,4,31,239,179,7,158,37,81,91,114,251,167,46,30,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
