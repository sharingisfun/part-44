Khoury, D. W. Harder (Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-21175-6\r\n\r\nThis textbook provides a step-by-step approach to numerical methods in engineering modelling. The authors provide a consistent treatment of the topic, from the ground up, to reinforce for students that numerical methods are a set of mathematical modelling tools which allow engineers to represent real-world systems and compute features of these systems with a predictable error rate. Each method presented addresses a specific type of problem, namely root-finding, optimization, integral, derivative, initial value problem, or boundary value problem, and each one encompasses a set of algorithms to solve the problem given some information and to a known error bound. The authors demonstrate that after developing a proper model and understanding of the engineering situation they are working on, engineers can break down a model into a set of specific mathematical problems, and then implement the appropriate numerical methods to solve these problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e95df11c5d486b64558cc3f4fcb65f85751e62","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+and+Modelling+for+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e95df11c5d486b64558cc3f4fcb65f85751e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,233,93,241,28,93,72,107,100,85,140,195,244,252,182,95,133,117,30,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
