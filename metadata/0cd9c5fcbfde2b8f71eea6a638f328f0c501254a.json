I have to say I waited a long time (From since I heard about the theatrical release) and I got even more giddy when I heard it was being shown on that special asian week in the US. But day in and out I waited and I never got my lovely Oneechanbara. And all of a sudden I spot it on a forum divided up in a bunch of rapidshare links. So strugglingly without a rapidshare account I downloaded it. And hell, this is a quite goody quality with English subtitles release.\n\nWith it I am including the poster and the trailer. The subtitles are hardcoded into the video, so I cant do anything about that.\n\nI just hope you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it. I did :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd9c5fcbfde2b8f71eea6a638f328f0c501254a","amp;dn":"Oneechanbara","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd9c5fcbfde2b8f71eea6a638f328f0c501254a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,217,197,252,191,222,43,143,113,238,166,166,56,243,40,240,197,1,37,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
