It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.\n\n\nOutput: DivX\nVideo Quality: 4854 kbps\nVideo Frame Rate: 30\nFormat: MPEG4 in original size and aspect ratio\n\nAudio: 320 kbps\nAudio Sample Rate: 48000\nFormat: AAC 2CH\n\nRuntime: 115 minutes\n\n\nPLEASE SEED and RATE.
