Proclaiming himself a knight, he sets out with his squire, Sancho Panza, to reform the world and revive the age of chivalry, choosing a slut to be his noble lady Dulcinea. He mistakes inns for castles, a play about chivalry for the real thing, flocks of sheep for armies, convicts for wronged prisoners, and windmills for giants. While he and Sancho are off on their adventures, his niece, her fiancee, and the local priest think up a strategy to get him back home.\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 710x470 29.97fps\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo 112Kbps\nRunning time: 0:55:20","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0ff76006b00790d50cd3b0871f895fdbb94f01","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Don+Quixote+%281933%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0ff76006b00790d50cd3b0871f895fdbb94f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,15,247,96,6,176,7,144,213,12,211,176,135,31,137,95,219,185,79,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
