Since the technology behind the Synclavier was evolving along with Zappa's music, approximately doubling its processing and memory capacity every two years, it gave the composer greater tools to work with to realize his compositions. Feeding the Monkies at Ma Maison was compiled for an LP by Zappa prior to his death, but never mastered and released, though some of the music on this CD was further edited and eventually issued in altered and brief form.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Zappa often revised his compositions, especially his works for Synclavier, which grew in complexity as he utilized the instrument, incorporating nearly impossible percussion parts and abstract themes that suggested a blend of 20th century classical music and dark, eerie film music. &quot;Buffalo Voice&quot; was cut substantially in length prior to its appearance on Civilization Phaze III, this longer edit is just as valuable, where one can hear snippets of his orchestrations that sound as if they have roots in his writing for 200 Motels, while adding the effects of a violin played to sound like a buzzing fly and daughter Moon Unit Zappa's spoken voice. The eerie choir of speed-manipulated voices is central to &quot;Secular Humanism,&quot; while &quot;Worms from Hell&quot; is an example of Zappa as the mad scientist in his studio lab, bringing to life a musical experiment that no one could have created. Both &quot;Feeding the Monkies at Ma Maison&quot; and &quot;Samba Funk&quot; are previously unissued in any form, the former a 20-minute masterpiece and the latter the most accessible of these sessions. While Frank Zappa's music for Synclavier may be too challenging for the casual fan of his music, serious listeners will find much to enjoy in this new treasury from his massive personal library of performances.\n\nThis is a synclavier album. If you like the more challenging tracks off Jazz From Hell (eg. Ã¢â‚¬Å“While You Were Art 2Ã¢â‚¬Â³) or cant get enough of the longer work-outs on Civlization 3 (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nite LiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beat the ReaperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) then this is a great find.\n\nIf you dont, then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably sound like Frank noodling on a casio keyboard. And since thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no cohesive melody to any of these tracks, the album tends to have an overall sound, while individual tracks come off as variations on each other.\n\nBasically, it lacks the sort of hooks which made up the more pop-based Jazz From Hell. Think of it as a Zappa symphony of sorts.\n\nI really enjoyed this one, though the title track sort of meandered. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Buffalo VoiceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secular HumanismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were the highlights for me. And with the bonus tracks, it comes to 56 minutes, which isnt bad for a ZFT posthumous release, which usually range from 25-50 minutes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
