Years of meticulous research capture every nuance of the synth at the center of four decades of popular music. The first choice for bass and lead sounds from electronic and hip hop to indie rock and beyond, no other synth comes close to this combination of power, richness, and musical tone. Delivering the true sound of a synth as famous as the artists who used it, MONARK is the holy grail of analog modeling.\n\nMONARK runs in REAKTOR PLAYER or the full REAKTOR 5 version, and is also optimized for easy browsing from the MASCHINE hardware.\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths-samplers/monark/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths-samplers/monark/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9539545375e1376c3f7fceaa024b377df1e60c86","amp;dn":"Native.Instruments.Monark.v1.0.MAC.OSX-ALiCE.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9539545375e1376c3f7fceaa024b377df1e60c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,57,84,83,117,225,55,108,63,127,206,170,2,75,55,125,241,230,12,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
