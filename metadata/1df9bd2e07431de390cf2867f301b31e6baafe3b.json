In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.\n\nYou'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected.
