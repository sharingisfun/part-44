Feverishly sought-after by genre aÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cionados since its belated discovery in the early 1990s, Grannie now gains its first-ever official reissue.  With quotes from drummer John Clark and keyboardist John Stevenson that tell the story of both band and album for the first time, this is the definitive release of one of the most valuable jewels of the early 1970s British progressive rock scene.\n==","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d46f142c7480ff28f9e20a12d9d54b58743a6b","amp;dn":"Grannie+-+Grannie+%281971%29+%28UK+prog+rock%29+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d46f142c7480ff28f9e20a12d9d54b58743a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,212,111,20,44,116,128,255,40,249,226,10,18,217,213,75,88,116,58,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
