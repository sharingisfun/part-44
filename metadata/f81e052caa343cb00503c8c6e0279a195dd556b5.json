Married to Rama, prince of Ayodhya, her journey in life takes her from exhilaration to anguish.\n\nAlong the way, she has to leave behind the luxury of royal comforts and live the simple, harsh life of a forest dweller, where danger is lurking in every shadow.\n\nEnsnared in the evil plans of the wicked demon-king Ravana, Sita is abducted and hidden away in Lanka. Will Rama muster up a strong army to rescue Sita from the demon's clutches? Will Sita return to Ayodhya to become queen of the land? Or is she destined to be mistrusted and live alone for the rest of her life?\n\nAdapted from the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana, this is a touching tale of love, honor, and sacrifice that reveals one woman's shining strength in an unforgiving world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81e052caa343cb00503c8c6e0279a195dd556b5","amp;dn":"Sita+-+Daughter+of+the+Earth+%28Campfire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81e052caa343cb00503c8c6e0279a195dd556b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,30,5,44,170,52,60,176,5,3,200,198,224,39,154,25,93,213,86,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
