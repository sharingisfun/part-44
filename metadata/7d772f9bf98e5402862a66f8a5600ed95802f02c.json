THANKS! ==\n==========================\n==========================\n==========================\n\nIf you don't know about this band, I can't say this is the best release to start with. Instead, search for their self-titled album, &quot;The Cat Empire&quot; or their recorded-in-Havana album, &quot;Two Shoes.&quot; You'll immediately fall in love with them, I promise. If you aren't completely satisfied, then I will let you download this torrent for FREE as a bonus! Also, they have a new album coming out called &quot;So Many Nights&quot; on September 22nd (only in Australia). I have listened to this in its entirety, and it does NOT disappoint! This band is quickly becoming my favorite EVER!\n\nAnyway, this torrent is more of a B-Sides and Rarities album with live recordings and the like, meant for the fans who can't get enough of this band. And, by the way, that's every single fan of this band. I put the genre as &quot;Other,&quot; because there isn't an option for Latin / Ska / Reggae. But just know that they are absolutely incredible. These lads represent Melbourne, Australia better than anyone else I know of (which, admitedly, isn't a very long list, but still)!\n\nSupport them! They deserve it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thecatempire.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thecatempire.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Cat Empire's description of this release:\n&quot;As the title of the album suggests, this musical package contains old tapes, funky breaks and some out-takes that didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t make our album. Featured are some almost forgotten recordings from the CE trio, live snatches from our 2nd ever gig and some unforgettable moments from our extensive travels; all put together in one fat soupy collage.&quot;\n\n\n\n============\nThe Cat Empire - Tapes, Breaks and Out-Takes track list:\n\n1. Wandering\n2. The Night That Never End\n3. The Chariot\n4. The Lost Song\n5. Wanted to Write a Love Song\n6. Song for the Day\n7. The Conspiracy\n8.
