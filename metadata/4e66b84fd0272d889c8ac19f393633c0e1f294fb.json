The authors, David Snellgrove and Hugh Richardson, are highly knowledgeable academics, who manage to write an approachable book for anyone interested in the history of this fascinating country. \r\n\r\nFirst published in 1968, this well formatted epub is based on the 2003 (the most recent) print edition. It contains the unedited text of the 1968 edition, with an additional chapter, and additional prefixes and appendices.\r\n\r\nIf you find any typos, please let me know in the comments section of this page.\r\n\r\n================================================================================\r\n\r\nQuote printed on the back of the book:\r\n\r\n&quot;The civilization of the Tibetan people is disappearing before our very eyes, and apart from a few gentle protests here and there the rest of the world lets it go without comment and without regret. Many civilizations have declined and disintegrated in the past, but it is rare that one has the opportunity of being an informed witness of such events.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e66b84fd0272d889c8ac19f393633c0e1f294fb","amp;dn":"A+Cultural+History+of+Tibet%2C+by+Snellgrove+and+Richardson%2C+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e66b84fd0272d889c8ac19f393633c0e1f294fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,102,184,79,208,39,45,136,156,138,193,159,57,54,51,192,225,242,148,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
