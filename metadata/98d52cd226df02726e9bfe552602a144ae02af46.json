I'm flooded with people sharing their childhood memories and their growing up adventures. Why? Because in the book I invoke the happy and the sad, the challenging and the hearteningÃ¢â‚¬â€the everlasting memories from the 80s!\nThe magical yet uncomplicated time when we didn't have LCDs and LEDs with hundreds of TV channels, but the entire country happily watched Mahabharata on DDI; When Internet, mobile phones, ATM cards and host of other gadgets had not invaded our lives. Life was simple. I wanted to bring a slice of it to you.\nAnd it all started with Sangram, the CEO of Think WhyNot, who suggested the idea of creating a special song for this nove Ever since, it has been an exciting journey from reading the first set of lyrics, to listening to the first music track till the fine outcome. That vision has now become a reality with the lead song Mano kal hi ki baat hai sung by Shaan and composed by Siddhartth Suhas. The track was produced by Raajeev Sharma, a veteraii in the music industry.\nI also love the fact that, besides Mano kal hi ki baat hai, which beautiful y captures the essence of those days, this album comprises of various other very famous and haunting nostalgic number;;. We all have heard them, during our growing up days and therefore they connect quite well to the theme.\nCome join us as we celebrate the simplicity of those good ol'days that we fondly remember in this album!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   VA - Like It Happened Yesterday\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Like It Happened Yesterday\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: dMC 14 &amp; Pioneer DVDRW\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\nRipped by............: gnv64 \nIncluded.............: NFO, M3U\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
