It was subsequently owned by Queen Christina of Sweden, the duc dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢OrlÃƒÂ¨ans of France, and the Colonna family in Rome. In 1901, J. Pierpont Morgan acquired the altarpiece, which was still in a private collection, paying the phenomenal sum of two million francs. MorganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son bequeathed the painting to the Metropolitan Museum in 1916, and it remains one of the great treasures of the collection.\nThis catalogue explores the altarpieceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commission in the context of RaphaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. Its fascinating history, new technical findings, and a reconstruction of the original altarpiece with its long-separated predella panels are featured. RaphaelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preparatory drawings and selected works by such mentors as Perugino, Pinturicchio, and Fra Bartolommeo are illustrated and supplement this intriguing history, which unfolded over the course of four centuries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5533eec35667b6382ecad16ca43f82598ebfbd05","amp;dn":"Raphael+at+the+Metropolitan+-+The+Colonna+Altarpiece+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5533eec35667b6382ecad16ca43f82598ebfbd05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,51,238,195,86,103,182,56,46,202,209,108,164,63,130,89,142,191,189,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
