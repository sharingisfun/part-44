An indispensable reference.\n\nBeside the English translation the original Arabic script is included for reference, practically positioned on each page along with the translation.\n\nThis version also provides parenthetical additions in many difficult verses, pointing out how these verses are to be understood. Some obvious abrogations are listed, too.\n\nOne example shows how this edition is particular useful to provide the context that Allah and Muhammad originally intended:\n\nSura 2:190: \\&quot;And fight in the way of AllÃƒÂ¢h those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, AllÃƒÂ¢h likes not the transgressors.\\&quot;\n\nThis is often quoted to demonstrate that Islam is capable of moderation. But the relevant footnote from Bukhari 4/2782 is generally omitted, as is the essential reference to Sura 9:36, as well as the continuation 2:191 through 2:195, which detail how Jihad is to be performed, and how Allah forgives any mistakes therein.\n\nThis is a compiled Windows Help file. The search function this provides is most helpful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305997c7e713a6aefdb871ac0fbeba7a250ca24a","amp;dn":"NobleQuran.chm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305997c7e713a6aefdb871ac0fbeba7a250ca24a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,89,151,199,231,19,166,174,253,184,113,172,15,190,186,122,37,12,162,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
