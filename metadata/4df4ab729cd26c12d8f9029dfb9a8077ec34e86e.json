The result: an award show with no budget, no skill and no hope that it would get anywhere. Created and run based entirely on the feedback of /v/, the /v/GAs are a way to recognize both the best and the worst that the gaming industry has to offer, and to have a bit of fun while doing so.\n\nThe first annual Vidya Gaem Awards show, as hosted by Duke and a very special guest!
