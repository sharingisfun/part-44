Inherent in these powers is a responsibility to take great care, because altering one small moment can have devastating consequences for the past, present, and future. But some time travÃ‚Â­elers are not exactly honorable, and sometimes unsavory deals must be struck to maintain order.\n\nWith the Infinityglass (central to understanding and harnessing the time gene) at large, the hunt is on to find it before someone else does.\n\nBut the Hourglass has an advantage. Lily, who has the ability to locate anything lost, has determined that the Infinityglass isn't an object. It's a person. And the Hourglass must find him or her first. But where do you start searching for the very key to time when every second could be the last?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae65903f93960cc72c2943e3ceaa52c9696017a","amp;dn":"Infinityglass+-+An+Hourglass+Novel+-+Myra+McEntire.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae65903f93960cc72c2943e3ceaa52c9696017a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,230,89,3,249,57,96,204,114,194,148,62,60,234,165,44,150,150,1,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
