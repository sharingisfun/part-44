In his book, Silverman-a walking, talking atheist billboard known for his appearances on Fox News-discusses the effectiveness, ethics and impact of the in-your-face-atheist who refuses to be silent.\r\n\r\nSilverman argues that religion is more than just wrong: it is malevolent and does not deserve our respect. It is our duty to be outspoken and do what we can to bring religion down. Examining the mentality, methods and issues facing the firebrand atheist, Silverman presents an overwhelming argument for firebrand atheism and reveals:\r\n\r\n- All religion is cafeteria religion and almost all agnostics are atheists.\r\n- American society grants religion a privileged status, despite the intentions of the Founding Fathers.\r\n- Christian politicians have adversely (and un-Constitutionally) affected our society with regard to science, health, women's rights, and gay rights.\r\n- The notion of &quot;atheist Jews&quot; is a lie forced on us by religion.\r\n- It is not &quot;Islamophobia&quot; to observe dangerous teachings and disproportionate violence in Islam.\r\n- Atheists are slowly but surely winning the battle.\r\n\r\nFighting God is a provocative, unapologetic book that takes religion to task and will give inspiration to non-believers and serve as the ultimate answer to apologists.\r\n\r\nDAVID SILVERMAN is the president of American Atheists and one of the best-known atheists in America. He has appeared on several television programs for on-air debates, including The Oâ€™Reilly Factor, Hannity, Scarborough Country, The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson, and the CNN special â€œAtheists: Inside the World of Non-Believers.â€ He lives in New Jersey with his wife and child. Fighting God is his first book.\r\n\r\nIncluded here are drm-free AZW3 and EPUB formats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f580c8cfbd62603565c76da0be3fe4b044b1180c","amp;dn":"Fighting+God+-+An+Atheist+Manifesto+-+David+Silverman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f580c8cfbd62603565c76da0be3fe4b044b1180c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,128,200,207,189,98,96,53,101,199,109,160,190,63,228,176,68,177,24,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
