But sometimes, software is just hard.\nA year and a half after receiving an iPhone as a birthday present, I am still amazed. It looks so simple and\nitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so easy to use, but behind it all is a world of complexity.\nApple has worked very hard to document the myriad APIs that make up the iPhone SDK and to provide\nsample code, but for some of us itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still not enough. Even Apple cannot afford to provide a chapterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of\nexplanation for each sample application. Their tutorials can be quite helpful, such as the one on Core Data, but\nwhat then?\nEnter iPhone Advanced Projects.\nRay Kiddy, who worked at Apple for 15 years in various roles, uses AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tutorial on Core Data as a\nstarting point and builds from there. More than providing just an introduction, Ray shows what itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like to use Core\nData in the real world.\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the difference between documentation and a book such as this. Of course, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop there.\nJoachim Bondo, creator of the much-lauded chess application Deep Green, shares his advice and\ntechniques for implementing correspondence gaming.\nNoel Llopis, a ten-year veteran of the gaming industry, author of C++ for Game Programmers, and\ninstructor of a two-day intensive class in OpenGL programming specifically for the iPhone, lends new meaning to\nmaking your application ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with a discussion of reflections and environment mapping in OpenGL. I found it\nto be a fascinating topic.\nMy knowledge of OpenGL is casual at best, but Ben Britten Smith provides such a clear explanation of\nparticle systems (think smoke and fire) that this was not a hindrance at all. The chapter really was a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œblastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to work\nthrough.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been on a private mailing list with Jonathan Saggau for several years now, and his explanations never\nfail to impress. Here, he discusses the difficult topic of improving interface responsiveness. (Be sure to have a copy\nof his sample code handy!)\nAnd thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the half of it! The projects also include an exploration into Core Audio, a framework for\npersisting data with SQLite, strategies for networking, techniques for debugging, the Apple Push Notification\nService (not for the faint of heart), and intelligent in-app e-mail.\nSometimes, software is hard. With these authors as your guides, it should make your work quite a bit\neasier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af27ee3ae324eb50a05039fe107aa790a8518632","amp;dn":"iPhone+Advanced+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af27ee3ae324eb50a05039fe107aa790a8518632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,39,238,58,227,36,235,80,160,80,57,254,16,122,167,144,168,81,134,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
