And it profiles the winners and losers in this epic evolutionary contest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the massive dinosaurs who disappeared long ago to the humble bacteria that have survived for billions of years virtually unchanged.\n\nNobody knows exactly where the seeds of life came from. Some believe the chemicals essential to life were brought here by meteorites, while others believe they arose naturally in the early oceans and atmosphere. But most researchers agree that carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen eventually linked up to form the basic molecules of life. Then, they slowly assembled into more and more complicated structures that could reproduce themselves. That set the stage for the blossoming of life.\n\nAt the heart of this amazing story is the quirky and chaotic process of evolution ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the ability of organisms to change their behavior and body shape over time to adapt to changing circumstances. For instance, a flock of birds (letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s call them the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmall beaksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) might face a changing climate that kills off its favorite food plant, which produces small, soft seeds that perfectly fit their small beaks. Luckily, due to random changes in their genetic codes, the flock produces a few newborn birds that have bigger beaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: David Heeley &amp; Suzanne Weinert\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: Triumph Of Life-The Four Billion Year War\nYear:  2001\nFile Size: 741 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:52:51\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1915 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (External English)\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title//&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title//&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitle included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site AGAIN.
