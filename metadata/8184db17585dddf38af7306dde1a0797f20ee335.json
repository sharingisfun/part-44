There are no subtitles. This is done by using MEGUI + MKVmergeGUI + SVP. It took me 17 hours and 40 min to render. The qualty is reasonble 720p. There are some artefacts around small, fast moving objects, but this is due to the level of calculation done by the algorithm used to insert a couple of frames between two original. It uses grid and because it will take enormous amount of time I did not used the highest settings.\n\nWatch the movie with media player clasic and installed codec pack. Or use windows media player.\n\nDO NOT USE ANY TYPE OF PLAYER WITH INTERNAL CODECS!!!!!!!!!!!! (etc. VLC,Kmplayer.....)\n\nIn my opinion the movie is great! It will be awesome if we start to care more about our own &quot;Pandora&quot;. \n\nPS:\nFor some stupid reason I was not able to show picture so here is link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaAfgaafo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaAfgaafo&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8184db17585dddf38af7306dde1a0797f20ee335","amp;dn":"Avatar+Extended+2009+%2860fps+pre-rendered%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8184db17585dddf38af7306dde1a0797f20ee335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,132,219,23,88,93,221,243,138,247,48,109,222,26,7,151,242,14,227,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
