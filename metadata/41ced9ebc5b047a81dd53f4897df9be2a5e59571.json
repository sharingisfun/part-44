While the market is crowded with many clinical and therapeutic pharmacology textbooks, the field of pharmacology is booming with the prospects of discovering new drugs, and virtually no extant textbook meets this need at the student level. The market is so bereft of such approaches that many pharmaceutical companies will adopt Hacker, et al. to help train new drug researchers.\n\nThe boom in pharmacology is driven by the recent decryption of the human genome and enormous progress in controlling genes and synthesizing proteins, making new and even custom drug design possible. This book makes use of these discoveries in presenting its topics, moving logically from drug receptors to the target molecules drug researchers seek, covering such modern topics along the way as side effects, drug resistance, Pharmacogenomics, and even nutriceuticals, one in a string of culminating chapters on the drug discovery process.\n\n*Uses individual drugs to explain molecular actions\n*Full color art program explains molecular and chemical concepts graphically\n*Logical structure reflecting the current state of pharmacology and translational research, starting with receptors and finishing with target molecules\n*Covers such intricacies as drug resistance and cell death\n*Consistent format across chapters and pedagogical strategies make this textbook a superior learning tool\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 608 pages\n    * Publisher: Academic Press; 1 edition (August 31, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 012369521X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0123695215","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ced9ebc5b047a81dd53f4897df9be2a5e59571","amp;dn":"Pharmacology+-+Principles+and+Practice%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ced9ebc5b047a81dd53f4897df9be2a5e59571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,206,217,235,197,176,71,168,29,213,63,72,151,223,155,226,165,229,149,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
