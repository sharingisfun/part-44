Its name: BIZARRO. For years, readers have been asking for a category of fiction dedicated to the weird, crazy, cult side of storytelling that has become a staple in the film industry (with directors such as David Lynch, Takashi Miike, Tim Burton, and even Lloyd Kaufman) but has been largely ignored in the literary world, until now. \n\nThe Bizarro Starter Kit features short novels and story collections by ten of the leading authors in the bizarro genre: \n\nD. Harlan Wilson\nCarlton Mellick III\nJeremy Robert Johnson\nKevin L Donihe\nGina Ranalli\nAndre Duza\nVIncent W. Sakowski\nSteve Beard\nJohn Edward Lawson\nBruce Taylor\n\nNote:  This was posted with the authors' approvals.  If you enjoy any of the stories, please go to amazon.com and write a review.
