Expressions of sanity and organization by the rhythm section seem detached from the wall of sound that Sanders and Coltrane have erected. \r\n\r\nThe best moments come when Coltrane breaks away from Sanders for solos â€“ echoes of Love Supreme can be heard in the repetitive, circular themes. Regardless of its seeming chaos, this is a deeply spiritual work, and can be seen as a darker, more unhinged version of the invocations heard on that album. \r\n\r\nIndeed, Om resonates with passion and yearning, but has a frantic edge that suggests that opening up to all of that powerful spiritual energy might have been a frightening experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*2011 Impulse! / Verve / UMG | B0015828-2\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nJohn coltrane: Tenor and soprano Saxophone\r\nPharoah Sanders: Tenor Saxophone\r\nDonald Garret: Clarinet\r\nMcCoy Tyner:Piano\r\nJimmy Garrison:Bass\r\nElvin Jones:Drums\r\nJoe Brazil: Flute\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded at Camelot Studios, Lynwood, WA on Octuber 1, 1965\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Coltrane - Live At The Village Vanguard Again!
