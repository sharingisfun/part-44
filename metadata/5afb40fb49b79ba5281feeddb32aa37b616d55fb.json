In Series 1, a former graduate of the college and now a Health &amp; Safety Manager in London is drafted in by the very louche Master (the always excellent Geoffrey Palmer) drafted in to examine the death of a College Fellow. The death toll rises until the hapless Simon somehow uncovers the murderer.\n\nIn Series 2, building on his success in Series 1, Simon has been appointed Professor of Forensic Medicine, despite not having the first idea about the subject. A student in the English Department is found cheating, but before he can be sent down, is found dead. Once more, it falls to Simon to somehow fall over the identity of the culprit.\n\nA great ensemble cast, playing a diverse bunch of mis-fits and an intelligent script make for great listening.
