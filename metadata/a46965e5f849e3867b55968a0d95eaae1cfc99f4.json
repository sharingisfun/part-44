A husband-and-wife pair of Bavarian tourists become stranded when their car breaks down; after a quarrel, the wife, Marianne Sagebrecht, gathers her luggage and stalks off. She stops at the Bagdad Cafe, a fleapit truckstop run by outspoken C.C.H. Pounder, who is also having husband problems. The Cafe has become a magnet for some of truly odd character: temperamental Hispanic cook George Aguilar, tattoo artist Christine Kaufmann, and onetime Hollywood set designer Jack Palance. Despite obvious personality differences, Sagebrecht and Pounder  become friends. Bagdad Cafe was later adapted into a short-lived American sitcom starring Jean Stapleton and Whoopi Goldberg. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095801/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095801/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-7245&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-7245&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:31:39\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x384 1.88:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1422 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,22 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a46965e5f849e3867b55968a0d95eaae1cfc99f4","amp;dn":"Bagdad+Cafe+%281987%29+Marianne+S%C3%83%C2%A4gebrecht+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a46965e5f849e3867b55968a0d95eaae1cfc99f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,105,101,229,248,73,227,134,123,85,150,138,13,149,234,174,28,252,153,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
