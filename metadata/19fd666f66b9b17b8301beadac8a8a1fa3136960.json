Meanwhile, beautiful Lolita is courted by villainous Captain Ramon, rich but effete Don Diego... and dashing Zorro, who is never seen at the same time as Don Diego. As Zorro continues to evade pursuit, Ramon puts the damsel in distress... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0011439/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0011439/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDon Q, Son Of Zorro - 1925\n\nDon Cesar de Vega, son of Zorro, is in Spain for his education.

But a quarrel ending in violence gives Don Sebastian the chance to dispose of his rival...by framing him for murder! Feigning suicide, Cesar escapes. Being a chip off the old block, a whip-wielding outlaw (this being his weapon rather than the sword) sets out to clear the name of Vega... \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015758/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015758/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIncludes DVD Extras.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19fd666f66b9b17b8301beadac8a8a1fa3136960","amp;dn":"The+Mark+Of+Zorro+%2B+Don+Q%2C+Son+Of+Zorro+%7B1920+%26amp%3B+1925%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19fd666f66b9b17b8301beadac8a8a1fa3136960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,253,102,111,102,185,177,123,131,1,190,173,172,138,138,31,163,19,105,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
