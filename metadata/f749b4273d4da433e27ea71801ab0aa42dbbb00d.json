Kairatune is engineered for the demanding producer who needs to push the sound to extremes without compromising audio quality.\n\nKairatune offers fast and intuitive sound design workflow. The user interface is designed for a musician rather than an engineer and is based on the concept of pitch and beat in contrast to frequency and time. Kairatune lets you travel in the world of beats, notes and intervals instead of the logarithmic mathematics of frequencies and the rarely useful absolute time.\n\nKairatune is not your all-in-one synthesizer. It's designed and engineered to be as powerful and versatile as possible in it's target role as your source for tight bass, unique lead and shiny SFX sounds. At the same time it makes all the effort to be simple enough to use, enabling you to add your personal touch and flavor to the sound and seek for the perfect fit to your mixing preferences.\n\nAU OS X:\nCopy the Kairatune.component to your components folder /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components\n\nVST OS X:\nCopy the Kairatune.vst to your VST plugins folder /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST\n\nSupport and info:\nhome:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://futucraft.com/kairatune&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://futucraft.com/kairatune&lt;/a&gt;\nforum: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=233&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=233&lt;/a&gt;\nemail:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;274c464e554653524942674152535244554641530944484a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nPlease report any bugs to the support email address or on the support forum.\n\n\nYou may use Kairatune for commercial music production.\n\nCredits:\nAdditional credits for sound design, usability design and testing to Ilkka Pajunen and Jyrki Pajunen.
