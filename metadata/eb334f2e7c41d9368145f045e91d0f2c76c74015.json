The library, however, is not self-explanatory. \nTo make full use of its components - and to benefit from their power - you \nneed a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.\n\nThe C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes \nthis library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11).
