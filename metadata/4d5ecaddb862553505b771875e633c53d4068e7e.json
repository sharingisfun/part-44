Shutt\n\nPublished by: Recorded Books (The Modern Scholar series)\nRead by: Timothy Shutt\nUnabridged\nBitrate: 64 kbs\nDuration: 8 hours\n\n\n\nBaseball has been celebrated as &quot;America's National Pastime&quot; for more than 150 years, and recalls what seems to be a more innocent age - long summer afternoons and sandlot ball, fresh rural air, and brownstone stoops. This course, presented by Kenyon College professor Dr. Timothy B. Shutt, is a celebration of baseball's rich past and of a game stronger than ever.\n\nAnd the game itself is ever young, the succession of baseball heroes unbroken: Honus Wagner to Ty Cobb to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, to Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, to Henry Aaron, Mickey Mantle, and Willie Mays, to Mike Schmidt, and Cal Ripken, and Tony Gwynn, to the stars of the present. Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Lefty Grove, Bob Feller, Sandy Koufax, Juan Marichal, and Bob Gibson, each generation has its heroes and cherishes the memory of those gone before as an ongoing counterpart to daily life-through the War and the Depression, through the fifties and sixties, and so on to the present day. This course is a celebration of baseball's rich past-and of a game stronger than ever.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAEmIAaDJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CAEmIAaDJ&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Ballgame-History-Baseball/dp/B001EBHFDE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300952355&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Ballgame-History-Baseball/dp/B001EBHFDE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300952355&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d5ecaddb862553505b771875e633c53d4068e7e","amp;dn":"Take+Me+Out+to+the+Ballgame+-+A+History+of+Baseball+in+America+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d5ecaddb862553505b771875e633c53d4068e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,94,202,221,184,98,85,53,5,183,113,135,94,99,60,83,212,6,142,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
