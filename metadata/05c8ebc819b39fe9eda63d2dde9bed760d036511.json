There are a lot of pages of just text and not much artwork, but what artwork there is was done by none other than the great Tim Vigil.  These are all excellent quality scans about 1000 pixels wide.  There are no advertising pages.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/fromthedeskofwarrenellis1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/fromthedeskofwarrenellis1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c8ebc819b39fe9eda63d2dde9bed760d036511","amp;dn":"From+The+Desk+Of+Warren+Ellis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c8ebc819b39fe9eda63d2dde9bed760d036511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,200,235,200,25,179,159,233,237,166,61,45,222,155,237,118,13,3,101,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
