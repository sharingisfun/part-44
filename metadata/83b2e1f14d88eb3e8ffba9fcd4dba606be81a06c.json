The timing could not be worse; Kitty needs all the allies she can muster to go against the ancient vampire, Roman, if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to have any hope of defeating his Long Game. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to this intruder than there seems, and Kitty must uncover the truth, fast. Meanwhile, Cormac pursues an unknown entity wreaking havoc across Denver; and a vampire from the Order of St. Lazaurus tempts Rick with the means to transform his life forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b2e1f14d88eb3e8ffba9fcd4dba606be81a06c","amp;dn":"Kitty+Rocks+The+House+by+Carrie+Vaughn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b2e1f14d88eb3e8ffba9fcd4dba606be81a06c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,178,225,241,77,136,235,62,143,251,169,252,212,219,166,6,190,129,160,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
