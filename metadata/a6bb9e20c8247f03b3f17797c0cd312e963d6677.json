The screenplay by Adrien Joyce focuses on two bumbling con men who plot to steal the fortune of a wealthy young heiress, played by Stockard Channing in her first film starring role.\n\nStockard Channing as Fredrika Quintessa Bigard\nJack Nicholson as Oscar Sullivan\nWarren Beatty as Nicky Wilson\nFlorence Stanley as Mrs. Gould\nRichard B. Shull as Detective Sgt. Power\nTom Newman as John the Barber\nJohn Fiedler as Police Photographer\nScatman Crothers as Fisherman\nBrian Avery as Airline Steward\nKathryn Grody as Police Secretary\nIan Wolfe as Justice of the Peace\nDub Taylor as Rattlesnake Tom\n\nVincent Canby of The New York Times called the film &quot;very funny,&quot; &quot;manically scatterbrained,&quot; and &quot;a marvelous attempt to recreate a kind of farce that, with the notable exceptions of a handful of films by Blake Edwards and Billy Wilder, disappeared after World War II.&quot; He added, &quot;The Fortune does have sequences that sag, and there are moments when it's obvious that farce is not exactly the native art of any of the people involved. One occasionally is aware of the tremendous effort that has gone into a particular effect, though that doesn't spoil it for me. The endeavor is nobly conceived in an era that has just about abandoned farce in favor of parody, satire, situation and/or wise-crack comedy, all of which Mr. Nichols already can do with Ã¢â‚¬â€œ perhaps Ã¢â‚¬â€œ too great an ease. The Fortune will probably be compared to The Sting, because of the overlapping of the eras and the con-man theme. Incorrectly, though. The Sting is an adventure. The Fortune is farce of a rare order.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bb9e20c8247f03b3f17797c0cd312e963d6677","amp;dn":"Mike+Nichols+-+The+Fortune+%281975%29+RIP+Mike","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bb9e20c8247f03b3f17797c0cd312e963d6677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,187,158,32,200,36,127,3,179,241,119,151,192,205,49,46,150,61,102,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
