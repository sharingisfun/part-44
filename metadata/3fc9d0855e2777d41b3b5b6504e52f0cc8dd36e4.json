The teen-aged title character Doyamoyee, played by Sharmila Tagore, may not be a &quot;goddess&quot; at all, but try telling that to Kalikinkar Roy (Chhabi Biswas), her wealthy and influential father. He places Doyamoyee on an outside pillar for all to see; the townsfolk are at first inclined to go along with Roy's illusion because of his financial status, but soon they've convinced themselves that the girl does indeed have divine powers. The girl's husband Umaprasad (Soumitra Chatterjee) wants her to put an end to what he considers nonsense. As a result....well, the results depend on whether you see the film's original ending, or Ray's &quot;rethought&quot; climax, filmed a year or so after Devi's completion. In addition to writing and directing the film, Ray also provided the musical score.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Devi.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 696 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1027 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.5 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 829 Kbps\n      Width : 416 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.217\n      StreamSize : 557 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      Codec profile : Dolby Digital\n      PlayTime : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 128 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0053765\n\nBengali audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc9d0855e2777d41b3b5b6504e52f0cc8dd36e4","amp;dn":"The+Goddess+%28Devi%29+-+Satyajit+Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc9d0855e2777d41b3b5b6504e52f0cc8dd36e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,201,208,133,94,39,119,212,27,59,91,101,4,229,47,12,200,221,54,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
