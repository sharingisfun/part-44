The gutters are running red with blood and the Police are powerless to stop it.\n\nFrank Harrison had ruled gangland unopposed for more than two years and yet someone is out to wipe him and his men from the face of the earth. Who and why? The answer, when it comes, will test not just Harrison's courage but his sanity too. For him, there is only one way to fight back against an enemy he can barely believe he faces.
