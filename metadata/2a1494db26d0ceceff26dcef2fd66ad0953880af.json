Comet. Nash pours all of his seemingly unrequited longing     \n   for Comet into a love song and visits Andy Bang's studio to record    \n        it. Deeply impressed, Andy offers to sell the song to an         \n   advertising company, promising big bucks.Poor love-sick Nash turns    \n      it down - he's no sell-out.Later, when Jane finds Nash in his      \n    bedroom looking like death, she takes him to the doctor, where he    \n    finds he's not just love-sick - he's got a highly unusual medical    \n     condition.Even with his medical bills piling up, it's only when     \n    Comet pays him a visit and completely misses the point of the new    \n   song that Nash decides to sell it.He has little time for self-pity    \n      however, Boy Crazy Stacey (BCS) have a gig with the Lovetones      \n          coming up and a chance to grab a spot on their tour.           \n      Unfortunately, when Jasper suffers a huge personal blow, Nash      \n     alienates everyone with his lack of sympathy and winds up doing     \n    the gig alone.The vague lyrics in Nash's new song create yet more    \n    confusion - Val thinks the song's about him and Jane thinks it's     \n    about her. Jane corners Nash and makes a move. And after so many     \n    false starts with Comet, Nash finds himself seriously tempted to     \n                          get back with his ex.                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                    &lt;a href=&quot;
