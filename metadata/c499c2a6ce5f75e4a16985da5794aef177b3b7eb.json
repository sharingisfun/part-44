It was the first single by a female artist to debut at number one in the U.S., and only the second single to do so after &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; by Michael Jackson. It spent eight weeks at the top of the chart, from September 24 to November 18, 1995, Carey's longest stay at the time alongside &quot;Dreamlover&quot; (1993). It replaced &quot; Gangsta's Paradise&quot; by Coolio, and was replaced by Whitney Houston's &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot;. &quot;Fantasy&quot; spent twenty-three weeks in the top forty and was successful on other Billboard formats, including the R&amp;B and dance charts. Its strong sales led it to be certified double platinum by the RIAA, Carey's first single to do so. It was ranked seventh on the Hot 100 year-end charts for 1995 and forty-ninth on the 1996 year-end charts.\n\n\n\n                            ***Fantasy.(1995)***\n\n\n                                  Enjoy!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c499c2a6ce5f75e4a16985da5794aef177b3b7eb","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey-Fantasy.%281995%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c499c2a6ce5f75e4a16985da5794aef177b3b7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,153,194,166,206,95,117,228,161,105,133,218,87,148,174,241,119,179,183,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
