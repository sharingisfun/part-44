Formats AZW3, EPUB, MOBI. First published 2005.\nFiction. Tags: Australia, Missing children, Mothers and daughters, Russia, World War\nisbn: 9780730443841\n\nThe beloved debut novel from one of Australia's foremost storytellers. Epic and passionate, White Gardenia will sweep you away ... or maybe not ...\n\n'Mama, Mama,' I said to myself, 'keep safe. You will survive, and I will survive, until we can find each other again.' In a district of the city of Harbin, a haven for White Russian families since Russia's Communist revolution, Alina Kozlova must make a heartbreaking decision if her only child, Anya, is to survive the final days of World War II.\n\nWhite Gardenia sweeps across cultures and continents, from the glamorous nightclubs of Shanghai to the harshness of Cold War Soviet Russia in the 1960s, from a desolate island in the Pacific Ocean to a new life in post-war Australia. Both mother and daughter must make sacrifices, but is the price too high? Most importantly of all, will they ever find each other again? Rich in incident and historical detail, this is a compelling and beautifully written tale about yearning and forgiveness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538ba7a9e3de27b2d1f10952317f113662218d56","amp;dn":"White+Gardenia+%28Fiction%29+-+Belinda+Alexandra.+AZW3%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538ba7a9e3de27b2d1f10952317f113662218d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,139,167,169,227,222,39,178,209,241,9,82,49,127,17,54,98,33,141,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
