It all started ten years ago, at a day called as 'Revival'. Then residents of the city slowly changed into beings that are partially human and partially animal. To this day, only a few still look fully human on the outside. One of these is Gii, a former medical student, now an illegal doctor that walks the city and cures the poor for free.\n\n\n\nIf you play translated visual novels in English - visit fuwanovel.org       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org&lt;/a&gt;\t\t   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/43&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fuwanovel.org/novels/43&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNote: No installation required.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cd562fd1ca5e4e2df294177b1dea024e1a30c9","amp;dn":"%5BFuwanovel%5D+Sekien+no+Inganock+-English-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cd562fd1ca5e4e2df294177b1dea024e1a30c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,205,86,47,209,202,94,78,45,242,148,23,123,29,234,2,78,26,48,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
