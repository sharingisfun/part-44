This work represents decades of research and spans television's entire history. \n\n\nWhile documentation regarding cast and personnel is now often found online, descriptions of the shows from authoritative sources are still not widely available. Terrace fills that gap with this work, which covers over 9,100 shows (including pilots) and constitutes the most comprehensive documentation of TV series ever published. \n\n\nAll the traditional genres are here along with show genres not well covered elsewhere - including children's programming, talk shows, game shows, stage plays, women's programming, dance, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7735a00effcc8342dd24085880456fb8dbc1a9ba","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+TV+Shows+1925-2007+4+Vol.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7735a00effcc8342dd24085880456fb8dbc1a9ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,53,160,14,255,204,131,66,221,36,8,88,128,69,111,184,219,193,169,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
