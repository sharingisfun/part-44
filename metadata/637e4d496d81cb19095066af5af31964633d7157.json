Joining the guitarist are four superb musicians:\ntenor saxophonist Chris Potter, pianist Edward Simon, bassist Scott Colley, and\ndrummer Clarence Penn. The many twists within the opener, &quot;Labyrinth,&quot; are\nfinessed with ease by the group, while Rogers adds a bit of distortion to his\ninstrument for the intense &quot;Tyranny of Fixed Numbers.&quot; The extended workout of\n&quot;The Maya&quot; is built upon an ostinato bass pattern, with Rogers and Potter\nplaying in unison until the piece opens up and the bassist's role is freed; then\nthe leader works his magic with an inventive solo. &quot;Apparitions&quot; is truly a\nhaunting melody as Rogers and Potter introduce the theme, with Penn gradually\nadding background percussion. The finale, &quot;Moment in Time,&quot; is an intriguing\nlow-key ballad, omitting the piano and tenor sax, while Colley (a veteran of\nguitarist Jim Hall's trio) responds to the stripped-down setting with some of\nhis best work of the session. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:637e4d496d81cb19095066af5af31964633d7157","amp;dn":"Adam+Rogers+-+Apparitions+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"637e4d496d81cb19095066af5af31964633d7157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,126,77,73,109,129,203,25,9,80,102,175,90,243,25,100,99,61,113,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
