Her new solo effort THE IMPERATIVE showcases a nicely matured but still energetic style that rocks expertly between hard and sweet without falling prey to the usual tough-girl singer-songwriter clichÃƒÂ©s.\n\nMaybe it's because she's no little girl. Mama d'Bruzzi is all woman and has nothing to prove to you; she's already proven it with a solid career as a pioneer of ovaries-to-the-wall hard rocking. If you're a fan of the riot-grrrl aesthetic then you're in her debt already even if you've never heard her sing or play a note.\n\nLyrically, d'Bruzzi is genuine as hell. She sings immediacies ripped straight from real life in a rich, pure, contralto with masterful inflection, layered on top of ass-kicking guitar-driven arrangements with the kind of tasteful restraint only the very seasoned can deliver. It's a rugged and tender ride; every sentiment sounds real, and every note sounds necessary.\n\nYou're gonna like this album.\n\n\t--Whatsblem the Pro 02/10/2013\n\n* = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * = * =\n\nMama Mia d'Bruzzi - THE IMPERATIVE\nCopyright 2012 Ptchoo Productions, All Rights Reserved\n\nWritten and performed by Mia d'Bruzzi\nwith additional material by Paul Simmans\nProduced by Paul Simmans\nRecorded Summer/Fall 2012 at Henry Street Studios, San Francisco\nMixed by Paul Simmans\nMastered by Michael Romanowski\nPhotos by Rachel Thoele\nCD design and layout by Emily Coon\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mamamiadbruzzi.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mamamiadbruzzi.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTRACK LIST:\n1.
