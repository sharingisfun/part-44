(transcoded from other lossy, for example MP3 audio source).\n If not, the 'lossless' file is fake.\n \nThe software name is---Audiochecker\nand you can download it from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.dester.hu/English/home_e.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.dester.hu/English/home_e.html&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is a standalone software and therefore you don't need to install it.\nI made some experiments and it works.\n\nthis is my first torrent -you need to start somewhere\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897f10dfc97e795e55dc97d259efc3c78dd778b3","amp;dn":"Paralyzed+-+The+Cardigans+-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897f10dfc97e795e55dc97d259efc3c78dd778b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,127,16,223,201,126,121,94,85,220,151,210,89,239,195,199,141,215,120,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
