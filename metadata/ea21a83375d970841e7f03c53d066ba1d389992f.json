The film is an adaptation of the operetta of the same name by composer Rudolf Friml and librettist Otto A. Harbach that premiered on Broadway in 1912. The film used nearly all of the music from the operetta but jettisoned the plot in favor of a new storyline set in Spain during the time of the Emperor Napoleon I. It added a new song, &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;, which became popular, as was one of the Friml songs, &quot;Giannina Mia&quot;, both of which were released on 78 r.p.m. gramophone records.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Jeanette MacDonald as Nina Maria Azara\n    Allan Jones as Don Diego / Captain Andre\n    Warren William as Colonel de Rouchemont\n    Billy Gilbert as Inn Keeper\n    Douglass Dumbrille as Marquis de Melito (as Douglas Dumbrille)\n    Henry Daniell as General Savary\n    Leonard Penn as Etienne DuBois\n    Tom Rutherford as King Ferdinard (as Tom Rutherfurd)\n    Belle Mitchell as Lola\n    George Zucco as St. Clair, Secret Service Chief\n    Corbet Morris as Duvall (as Corbett Morris)\n    Matthew Boulton as Duke of Wellington\n\nDirected by Robert Z.
