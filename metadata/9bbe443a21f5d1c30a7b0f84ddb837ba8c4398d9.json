After a copy found its way to BBC disc jockey, John Peel, he began playing tracks regularly, which helped pave the way for a real record contract (the label initially wanted him to re-record Northern Dream, but he had other ideas, which led to the formation of Be Bop Deluxe). \n\nWhile largely acoustic, singer-songwriter fare -- at some points he sounds like an Anglicized Neil Young, in fact, filtered through Michael Chapman -- and typical of its day (even down to the way Nelson looks on the back cover, with patched flares and long, stringy hair), there's also a spirit of future experimentalism lurking under the songs. The backwards guitar work that tops and tails &quot;Sad Feelings&quot; offers a hint of things to come, while both &quot;House Of Sand&quot; and &quot;See It Through&quot; recall Be Bop's &quot;Jets At Dawn.&quot; \n\nOne thing never in doubt is his guitar ability. While it's hardly as developed as it would become, &quot;Smiles,&quot; for example, illustrates some excellent picking. The songwriting has an engaging naivetÃƒÂ©, an innocence that would soon vanish, but that's part of its charm, too. While hardly essential, it's still fascinating for anyone interested in Nelson's roots, and it is the foundation of his sound.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Photograph (A Beginning)\n02 - Everyone's Hero\n03 - House Of Sand\n04 - End Of The Seasons\n05 - Rejoice\n06 - Love's A Way\n07 - Northern Dreamer (1957)\n08 - Bloo Blooz\n09 - Sad Feelings\n10 - See It Through\n11 - Smiles\n12 - Chymepeace (An Ending)\n\n*2011 Esoteric / Cocteau Discs / Cherry Red | COCD 1001\n\n\n\nEnjoy and sharing, Thanks!\n\n\n\nSome Bill Nelson Album's....\n\n\nBill Nelson - Captain Future's Psychotronic Circus(2010) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12278072/Bill_Nelson_-_Captain_Future_s_Psychotronic_Circus_%282010%29_%5BEAC-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12278072/Bill_Nelson_-_Captain_Future_s_Psychotronic_Circus_%282010%29_%5BEAC-&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBill Nelson - Signals From Realms Of Light (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11770655/Bill_Nelson_-_Signals_From_Realms_Of_Light_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11770655/Bill_Nelson_-_Signals_From_Realms_Of_Light_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Nelson - Return To Tomorrow (2012)[EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11788464/Bill_Nelson_-__Tomorrow_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11788464/Bill_Nelson_-__Tomorrow_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nBill Nelson - Fantasmatron (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11786042/Bill_Nelson_-_Fantasmatron_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11786042/Bill_Nelson_-_Fantasmatron_%282011%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbe443a21f5d1c30a7b0f84ddb837ba8c4398d9","amp;dn":"Bill+Nelson+-+Northern+Dream+%281971%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbe443a21f5d1c30a7b0f84ddb837ba8c4398d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,190,68,58,33,245,209,195,10,123,15,132,221,184,55,186,140,67,152,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
