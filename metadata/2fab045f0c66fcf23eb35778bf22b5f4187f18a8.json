DON'T ASK FOR THINGS TO BE FIND VIA TPB (your comment will be deleted), join suprbay instead and PM me there.\n\n\nCheers\n\nMaestral","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fab045f0c66fcf23eb35778bf22b5f4187f18a8","amp;dn":"A-10+Warthog+-+Details+%2AMaestral%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fab045f0c66fcf23eb35778bf22b5f4187f18a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,171,4,95,12,102,252,242,62,179,87,120,191,34,181,244,24,127,24,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
