Joe wants to know: is this possible? And if our minds could, in fact, be transferred into a robotic body, would we still be human? Maybe we'd be a whole new species - the &quot;robosapien&quot;. Joe then brings up modern advances in &quot;virtual reality&quot;. If our fake existence were better than our real one, would we choose to ignore reality? These are big questions, and Joe wants to know if this is all just really cool science fiction, or a vision of things to come. How soon could all of this become reality?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2183b58743b5afe7d27166311fcaf856cb1cf905","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Questions+Everything+-+S01E03+-+Robosapien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2183b58743b5afe7d27166311fcaf856cb1cf905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,131,181,135,67,181,175,231,210,113,102,49,31,202,248,86,203,28,249,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
