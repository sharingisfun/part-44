With the help of her young companion, Yongden, she willingly suffered the primitive travel conditions, frequent outbreaks of disease, the everÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬present danger of border control and the military to reach her goal.\n\nThe determination and sheer physical fortitude it took for this woman, delicately reared in Paris and Brussels, is inspiration for men and women alike.\n\nDavidÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¬Neel is famous for being the first Western woman to have been received by any Dalai Lama and as a passionate scholar and explorer of Asia, hers is one of the most remarkable of all travellers tales","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a68e3c4fa8e9e334d7e832fb8a7c35129f2c6d7","amp;dn":"Alexandra+David-Neel+-+My+Journey+to+Lhasa+%28366p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a68e3c4fa8e9e334d7e832fb8a7c35129f2c6d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,104,227,196,250,142,158,51,77,126,131,47,184,167,195,81,41,242,198,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
