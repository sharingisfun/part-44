He tells of his childhood in Ontario, where his father instilled in him a love for the written word; his first brush with mortality when he contracted polio at the age of five; struggling to pay rent during his early days with the Squires; traveling the Canadian prairies in Mort, his 1948 Buick hearse; performing in a remote town as a polar bear prowled beneath the floorboards; leaving Canada on a whim in 1966 to pursue his musical dreams in the pot-filled boulevards and communal canyons of Los Angeles; the brief but influential life of Buffalo Springfield, which formed almost immediately after his arrival in California. He recounts their rapid rise to fame and ultimate break-up; going solo and overcoming his fear of singing alone; forming Crazy Horse and writing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cinnamon Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cowgirl in the Sand,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Down by the RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in one day while sick with the flu; joining Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, recording the landmark CSNY album, DÃƒÂ©jÃƒÂ  vu, and writing the song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ohio;Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ life at his secluded ranch in the redwoods of Northern California and the pot-filled jam sessions there; falling in love with his wife, Pegi, and the birth of his three children; and finally, finding the contemplative paradise of Hawaii. Astoundingly candid, witty, and as uncompromising and true as his music, Waging Heavy Peace is Neil YoungÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey as only he can tell it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf4e39a15ac0dd72126f25b22b03e96d3bbb383","amp;dn":"Waging+a+heavy+peace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf4e39a15ac0dd72126f25b22b03e96d3bbb383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,244,227,154,21,172,13,215,33,38,242,91,34,176,62,150,211,187,179,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
