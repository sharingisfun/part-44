Louise Hay reads her power thoughts to you in her own warm, nurturing voice. Listen to one power thought each day or a few at a time. However you decide to play this cd, you&amp;#039;ll find that you may begin to think more positively and create exciting changes in your life!\n\nContinuing her long career as teacher, author, and audio publisher, Louise Hay offers a collection of affirmations that cover a lot of issues. Relationships, living circumstances, finances, career, emotional balance, health, driving, eating, relationships with animals, music--every wish one could have for a positive life is expressed here with great compassion. Hay sounds even more alive and young than in some of her previous audios, and the ideas behind these affirmations are very current. It&amp;#039;s difficult to think of anyone doing this type of audio who sounds more loving and helpful. And the music (always a challenge with affirmation audios) contributes nicely to making this a useful and economically priced resource. T.W.
