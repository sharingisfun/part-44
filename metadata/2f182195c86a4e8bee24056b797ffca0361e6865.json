It inherits many of the best features of\nC++ and Microsoft Visual Basic but few of the inconsistencies and anachronisms, resulting in\na cleaner and more logical language. With the advent of C# 2.0 in 2005, several important\nnew features were added to the language, including generics, iterators, and anonymous\nmethods. C# 3.0, available as part of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, adds further features,\nsuch as extension methods, lambda expressions, and, most famously of all, the Language\nIntegrated Query facility, or LINQ. The development environment provided by Visual Studio\n2008 makes these powerful features easy to use, and the many new wizards and enhancements\nincluded in Visual Studio 2008 can greatly improve your productivity as a developer.\n\n\nWho This Book Is For\n====================\n\n                              The aim of this book is to teach you the fundamentals of programming with C# by using\nVisual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework version 3.5. You will learn the features of the C#\nlanguage, and then use them to build applications running on the Microsoft Windows operating\nsystem. By the time you complete this book, you will have a thorough understanding\nof C# and will have used it to build Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications,\naccess Microsoft SQL Server databases, develop ASP.NET Web applications, and build and\nconsume a Windows Communication Foundation service.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f182195c86a4e8bee24056b797ffca0361e6865","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Visual+C%23+STEP+%2F+STEP+%28KAKTOS%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f182195c86a4e8bee24056b797ffca0361e6865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,24,33,149,200,106,78,139,238,36,5,107,121,127,252,160,54,30,104,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
