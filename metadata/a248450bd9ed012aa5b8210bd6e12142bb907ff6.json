A Korean psychedelic rock masterpiece!! Only this album released about 500 copies!! First pressing has not the A5 and B5 song, but only it just appeared the songs on the cover track list. Members are Shin Jung-Hyun (Guitar and Vocal), Lee Nam-Lee (Bass), Kim Ho-Sik (Drum). It is different Musical performance and Drummer compared to the second pressing. The first pressing was reissued only with a paper sleeve gate fold cover on CD format at recently days. First pressing had a psychedelic musical performances. The second pressing had hard rock styled musical\nperformances. The reason is that record company wants popular rock sounds, and while the first pressing is not, they wanted to record it again. That's how shin jung hyun had to record it again. First pressings were only given to a broadcasting station. So it was a very rare and expensive (over 900$) at these days. Second pressing is not so rare and low price (under 100$). First pressing was reissued only by C.D, but at the reissue C.D dubbed guitar sounds. So I missed it!! This first pressing is best in fact the best combination of styles (of Western rock music combined with Korean traditional rhythms) of all his records. It is a great eastern psychedelia!! Only I just can say that 'He almost completed his hope (to combine Western music with Korean traditional rhythm) at this album.' Just you must feel it!!&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Jung-hyeon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Jung-hyeon&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a248450bd9ed012aa5b8210bd6e12142bb907ff6","amp;dn":"Shin+Jung+Hyun+%26amp%3B+Yup+Juns++%281974%2F2003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a248450bd9ed012aa5b8210bd6e12142bb907ff6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,72,69,11,217,237,1,42,165,184,33,11,214,225,33,66,187,144,127,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
