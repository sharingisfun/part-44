Boths CDs are shop bought and in perfect condition. 2 Tracks could not be verified as accurate. I listened to both tracks to try and hear if there was noises or skips but nothing surfaced. I actually ripped CD-02 twice, I gave the cd a good clean to make sure no finger prints or dirt had attached to the CD, but the same results were obtained.\nSo Im just letting the downloader know of this issue and its up to them  to make a judgement to download or not.\n\nCD-02 Track 10 - The Smashing Pumpkins - Perfect (Perfecto Mix).wav\n     Peak level 98.9 %\n     Extraction speed 13.6 X\n     Track quality 99.7 %\n     Test CRC 26DF8089\n     Copy CRC 26DF8089\n     Cannot be verified as accurate (confidence 12)  [7FE650C6], AccurateRip returned [59E97FAE]  (AR v2)\n     Copy OK\n\nCD-03 Track  06 - Grace - Not Over Yet (Perfecto Mix).wav\n     Peak level 98.9 %\n     Extraction speed 15.3 X\n     Track quality 99.9 %\n     Test CRC 36DA8F19\n     Copy CRC AD9F06E0\n     Cannot be verified as accurate (confidence 11)  [A075C82C], AccurateRip returned [DCF76F6E]  (AR v2)\n     Copy OK\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1532c4732862b5d9b0c3e304f7d971cd784f9b","amp;dn":"Paul+Oakenfold+%26ndash%3B+Greatest+Hits+%26amp%3B+Remixes%5B2007%5D%5Bonly1jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1532c4732862b5d9b0c3e304f7d971cd784f9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,21,50,196,115,40,98,181,217,176,195,227,4,247,217,113,205,120,79,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
