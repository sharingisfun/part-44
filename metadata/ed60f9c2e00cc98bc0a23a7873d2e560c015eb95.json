The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.\n\nA normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.\n\n&quot;Le Freak&quot; is a 1978 hit disco song by Chic. It was the band's third single and first Billboard Hot 100 and sole number-one song. A New York Times critic describes the song as a &quot;haunting, minimalist pop-funk built around the guitar and bass&quot;. \n\nAlong with the tracks, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; and &quot;Chic Cheer&quot;, &quot;Le Freak&quot; stayed at number one on the disco charts for seven weeks. The single bears the distinction of being the highest selling record ever on Atlantic Records, and the highest-selling single ever on WEA until it was displaced in 1990 (by Madonna's &quot;Vogue&quot;).\n\nThe single achieved sales of over four million and also reached number seven in the UK singles chart.\n\nThe song was ranked at number 19 on Billboard Magazine's top 100 songs of the first 50 years of the Hot 100 chart.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Freak&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Freak&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aabnKaADC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aabnKaADC&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 4666kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:31\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
