Jimmy talks with Seth Rogen, Kobe Bryant vs Titus in Clash of the Titus.\n\nNFO ---&gt; There is what appears to be a video glitch at 6:37 however it is not a glitch but 15 seconds of dead air that was broadcast by ABC. I recorded the show from 2 sources and both have an ABC logo for 15 seconds an no Kimmel. When the video feed returns it appears that the video has jumped forward so I removed the dead air spot  and spliced it together. It is what it is. Enjoy. Also could it hurt for you guys to throw up some comments once in a while?! A Thank You goes a long way!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbbd7ba19482a47ef356a7bb496584a1fc0992f9","amp;dn":"Jimmy.Kimmel.Game.Night.2013.06.09.Seth.Rogen.READNFO.HDTV.x264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbbd7ba19482a47ef356a7bb496584a1fc0992f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,189,123,161,148,130,164,126,243,86,167,187,73,101,132,161,252,9,146,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
