Exiled throughout the Middle East, the Palestinian people placed their hope in Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, but when the 1967 war ended in disaster, they turned to more radical tactics, including airline hijackings. This utterly riveting documentary, produced for Swedish television, tells the story of Ms. Khaled, the poster girl for the Palestinian liberation movement, who was involved in a pair of hijackings, and who now works on behalf of her people as a member of the Palestinian National Council. For anyone interested in the often byzantine history of Palestine and Israel, this is essential viewing. Leila Khaled was the first woman to hijack a plane. In 1969, she showed her grenades to the terrified passengers by order of the Che Guevara commando unit of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Through the ensuing media bombardment, she put the Palestinian nation on the global map. The pretty 24-year-old Leila became a hero to many Palestinians, including the Swedish/Palestinian teenager Lina Makboul, who is now a filmmaker. At least Leila dared to do something, Lina thought at the time. She visits Leila 35 years later with a camera, and finds a woman who does not regret anything.\n\nIn Swedish, English and Arabic.
