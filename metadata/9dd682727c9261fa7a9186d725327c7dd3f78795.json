More and more amateur astronomers are turning to this interesting ? and scientifically useful ? area.\n\nThe concept of the book ? and of the series ? is to present an up-to-date detailed description of the objects, their physics and their evolution (part one); and then (part two) to consider how to observe and record them successfully.  \n\nDouble &amp; Multiple Stars, and How to Observe Them is a mine of information for all levels of amateur observers, from the beginner to the experienced; it is equally fascinating for practical astronomers, and also for those who simply want to find out more about these unusual star systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd682727c9261fa7a9186d725327c7dd3f78795","amp;dn":"Double+%26+Multiple+Stars%2C+and+How+to+Observe+Them","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd682727c9261fa7a9186d725327c7dd3f78795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,214,130,114,124,146,97,250,122,145,134,215,37,50,124,125,211,247,135,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
