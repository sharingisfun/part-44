He and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's. The film is based on the first three books in the series.\n\nRuntime.......:1h 28mn\nLanguage..........:ENGLISH\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate                         : 975 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 272 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.224\nStream size                      : 615 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 28mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 80.7 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\nIMAGiNE NOTES\nVIDEO:Legend of the Guardians russian video..................Thanks\nAUDIO:OWN\n\nFirst we took the russian video, which wasn't too bad but had faults... lots of glares, too much chroma, weak contrast and cropped a fair bit. We tried to fix most of the stuff... increased the contrast, lowered the chroma, toned down the glares and we also resized it to give it a 0.1% AR error correction compared to it's 0.8% in it's original res. The cropping... well nothing we can do about that :lol: The audio is our own line... not the best we've had but decent enough and much better than the cam audio so... Syncing was a bitch aswell... not easy syncing to owls mouths :P\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-20430.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-20430.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-20569.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-20569.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-21814.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-21814.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-22758.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/Legend%20of%20the%20Guardians%20The%20Owls%20of%20Ga%27Hoole/vlcsnap-22758.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219342/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219342/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ae6ec4ad4aa61859c05a68a5ff31aa60302c96","amp;dn":"Legend+of+the+Guardians+The+Owls+of+Ga%5C%27Hoole+TS+XViD+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ae6ec4ad4aa61859c05a68a5ff31aa60302c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,174,110,196,173,74,166,24,89,192,90,104,165,255,49,170,96,48,44,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
