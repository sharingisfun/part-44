Pierre Trudeau almost did, leading him (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) into a whizzing stream of traffic that almost crushed both of them. Alistair MacLeod accused him of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“home invasionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to grab the manuscript of No Great Mischief. And Paul Martin denounced him to a laughing Ottawa crowd, saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If Shakespeare had had Doug Gibson as an editor, there would be no Shakespeare!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On the other hand, Alice Munro credits him with keeping her writing short stories when the world demanded novels. Robertson Davies, with a nod to Dickens, gratefully called him Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Partner Frequent.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ W.O. Mitchell summoned up a loving joke about him, on his deathbed. Stories About Storytellers shares these tales and many more, as readers follow Doug Gibson through 40 years of editing and publishing some of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sharpest minds and greatest storytellers. Gibson is a terrific storyteller himself, and through his recollections we get an inside view of Canadian politics and publishing that rarely gets told. From Jack HodginsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Vancouver Island to Harold HorwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Labrador, from Alice MunroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ontario to James HoustonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arctic, Doug Gibson takes us on an unforgettable literary tour of Canada, going behind the scenes and between the covers, and opening up his own story vault for all to read and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88a59bce1582ecb3972e6f00a1fe5039ea2d7348","amp;dn":"Stories+About+Storytellers+-+Douglas+Gibson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88a59bce1582ecb3972e6f00a1fe5039ea2d7348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,165,155,206,21,130,236,179,151,46,111,0,161,254,80,57,234,45,115,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
