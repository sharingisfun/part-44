This four-disc boxset comes with four of Shimizu&amp;#039;s representative films: Children in the Wind (1937), Nobuko (1940), Mikaheri no Tou (1941), and Four Seaons of Children (1939), which is only being released with this boxset as a bonus feature. One of the undisputed masters of Japan cinema, Shimizu Hiroshi (1903-1966) made well over 100 films in his career, ranging from children&amp;#039;s films to lighthearted comedies to stories from the fringe. His outstanding cinematic achievements match that of contemporary great and lifelong friend Ozu Yasujiro, though the latter has eclipsed him in recognition. Shimizu Hiroshi is particularly well known for his children&amp;#039;s films, but his steady stream of output for Shochiku from the 1920s to 1950s yielded a far wider selection of films, many of which have been sadly lost to time. In comparison to Ozu&amp;#039;s films which are readily available, Shimizu&amp;#039;s works have been near impossible to find outside of the festival circuit, but Shochiku is now finally releasing Shimizu&amp;#039;s films on DVD with English subtitles. Kaze no Naka no Kodomo (Children in the Wind) (1937, B&amp;W, 86min) Based on a Tsubota Joji novel, Children in the Wind is probably Shimizu&amp;#039;s most well-known work, and helped establish his reputation as a children&amp;#039;s film director. Brothers Zenta (Hayam Masao) and Sanpei (Bakuden Kozo) carelessly wile their summer away in the countryside, bullying neighbor Kintaro and fighting over who gets to deliver their father&amp;#039;s daily lunchbox. Sunny days come to an abrupt end when their father is accused of forging documents and put in jail. While his mother looks for work, Sanpei is sent away to stay with his father&amp;#039;s retired schoolmaster, but he can&amp;#039;t stop getting into trouble. Nobuko (1940, B&amp;W, 90min) Renowned actress/singer Takamine Mieko stars as titular heroine Nobuko, a spirited young teacher working in a conservative school. Based on a novel by Shishi Bunroku, the film follows her experiences as she challenges the school with her liberal thinking and teaching methods. Mikaheri no Tou (1941, B&amp;W, 111min) Starring Ryu Chishu from Ozu Yasujiro&amp;#039;s Otoko wa Tsuraiyo, Mikaheri no Tou realistically explores the nature of children&amp;#039;s education. Set in a mountain boarding school, the film tells various stories about the school&amp;#039;s teachers and problem students. Kodomo no Shiki (Four Seasons of Children) (1939, B&amp;W, 146min) A follow-up to Children in the Wind, Four Seasons of Children is also based on a Tsubota Joji novel. The film is divided into two chapters, following the young protagonists&amp;#039; minor adventures and real-world awakenings over spring and summer, then autumn and winter.

The story is simple, two young boys are usurped from being the head of their gang of children by the son of the man who indicts their father on charges of embezzlement (him being fired and arrested for this.) They&amp;#039;re sent to live with their uncle (Takeshi Sakamoto, fast becoming my favorite Japanese actor of this decade) and spend their time thinking of ways to escape back home. Father is found innocent, and they live happily ever after. This film is beautiful, the music and the sound of the children playing are both unforgettable. It was no. 4 in the Kinema Jumpo that year, and it was adapted from a Tsubota novel (his 1939 film Four Seasons of Childhood, which contains the same characters, is also based on a Tsubota book.) The cinematography is &quot;gliding&quot; (a term which consistently seems to be used to describe the look and feel of his films) and more reminiscent of Arigato-San than any other film I&amp;#039;ve seen by him. There are also some strong similarities in plot and character to Ozu&amp;#039;s I Was Born But&amp; and according to Keiko McDonald he, &quot;tells of finding himself in tears as he read in the short story (Naoya Shiga&amp;#039;s &quot;Manazuru&quot;) about the little children shuffling along a road at night&quot;. I watched Children in the Wind without subtitles, but more than any other unsubtitled film I&amp;#039;ve seen, It was extremely easy to follow along with. One of my favorites from this director, and I can&amp;#039;t wait to see more of his children&amp;#039;s films.
