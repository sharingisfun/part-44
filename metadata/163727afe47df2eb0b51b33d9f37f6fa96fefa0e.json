Upper class people are \nactually aliens corrupting America. And the only way to see them is to wear special \nsunglasses that our hero, Nada, stumbles upon. This film has some cool ideas: the \nway all magazines and signs have subliminal messages, the paranoia, and the \nB-movie-on-purpose-so-it-feels-like-a-B-movie feel. It also has some really great \ncheesy one liners which I don't wish to spoil. Let it be known though, by the end \nof the movie you might just see a little of Ash from Evil Dead in Nada. The film \nalso has a fight scene around the middle that is particularly funny to watch because \nit keeps going forever.\nUploader comment... purposely made to look like a B Movie and panned by the critics.\nIts worth the download just to look at Meg Fosters eyes! And this movie led to things\nlike Hulk Hogan and The Rock becoming movie actors in Roddy Pipers Wake. In my opinion More \nrelevent today than it was in the late eightees. Apparently a re-make is due!\nOne of my favourite movies of all time! Sad bastard that I am! \nRoddy Piper\t     ... George Nada\nKeith David\t     ... Frank Armitage\nMeg Foster\t     ...
