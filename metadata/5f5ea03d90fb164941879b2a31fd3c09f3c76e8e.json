This close work with visual artists is readily apparent when watching OmodakaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music videos. Soichi Terada originally studied computer science at the University of Electro-Communications. During his stint there, he did some work as a session musician. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been composing, remixing, and arranging tracks for a variety of albums and projects since 1989. He started the music label FarEast Recording.
