The band split up after Schuldiner's death in 2001.\n\n-------------------------------\nSpiritual Healing is the third album released by Death in February 1990. The title comes from the era when faith healer Peter Popoff was exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson by James Randi as a fraud. This album is currently out of print. However, Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy are still in print, and are of the same label. This was also the first album to incorporate progressive metal elements due to more varied time signatures and longer song lengths.\n--------------------------------\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Living Monstrosity&quot; (Chuck Schuldiner) - 5:08\n   2. &quot;Altering the Future&quot; (Schuldiner, Terry Butler) - 5:34\n   3. &quot;Defensive Personalities&quot; (Schuldiner, Butler) - 4:45\n   4. &quot;Within the Mind&quot; (Schuldiner, James Murphy) - 5:34\n   5. &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; (Schuldiner) - 7:44\n   6. &quot;Low Life&quot; (Schuldiner, Murphy, Butler) - 5:23\n   7. &quot;Genetic Reconstruction&quot; (Schuldiner, Murphy, Butler) - 4:52\n   8. &quot;Killing Spree&quot; (Schuldiner, Murphy) - 4:16\n---------------------------------\nCredits\n\n    * Chuck Schuldiner - Guitar, Vocals\n    * James Murphy - Guitar\n    * Terry Butler - Bass\n    * Bill Andrews - Drums\n\n    * Recorded and mixed at Morrisound Recording, Tampa, Florida, USA\n    * Produced, recorded and mixed by Scott Burns and Death\n    * Assistant engineered by John Cervini and Mike Gowan\n\n    * Edward Repka - Artwork, Cover Design\n    * David Bett - Art Direction\n    * Brian Freeman - Design\n    * J.J.
