The villain this time is a South African diplomat (Joss Ackland) who doubles \n\nas a drug dealer. Though Riggs knows what's going on thanks to characterless character witness Joe Pesci, he can't touch the \n\nvillain because of &quot;diplomatic immunity.&quot; After perils too numerous to mention, Riggs and Murtaugh shoot it out with the \n\nheavies on the deck of a South African cargo ship. Lethal Weapon 2, of course, contains as one of its comic high-points a now \n\nfamous suspense scene: Mel Gibson agonizingly attempting to extricate a terrified Danny Glover from a booby-trapped toilet \n\nseat. Gibson, Glover, Donner and Joe Pesci would be reunited three years later for Lethal Weapon 3 and in 1998 for Lethal \n\nWeapon 4.\n\n                            \n\n\n\t\t\t\tM P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t                                 Rated R\n\n\n\n\t\t\t       R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n\t\t\t\t\t7 July 1989\n\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******:\n         * Video - UNTOUCHED - 4259 Kbps\n         * Audio - English, French\n         * Subs  - English, Spanish, French\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n\n        Extras **********:\n         * All\n\n        Ripped **********:\n         * Nothing\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\n1.
