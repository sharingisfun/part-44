Founded and fronted by Eddie Solis, the band has released the three studio albums Buicregl (2002), Stop Listening to Bad Music (2004), and The New Los Angeles (2007) all on CD and LP. It's Casual has performed with groups such as Story of the Year, Fu Manchu, Mastodon, High on Fire, and Zeke.[1]\n\nHistory\nEarly years\n\nIt's Casual was formed in 2001 in Los Angeles, starting with Eddie Solis on guitar, a bassist, drums, and a second guitar player.[1] The name was inspired by a line in The Wild Life, Cameron Crowe's follow up to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Solis soon met W.C.E., the drummer for Co-Ed and realized they had similar interests, such as Black Flag, The Melvins, and arena rock like Kiss and AC/DC. W.C.E. pitched the idea of a two piece band and It's Casual reformed with W.C.E on drums.[1] The band has a hardcore punk and doom metal sound,[1] with Solis on vocals and guitar[2] and W.C.E. on drums.[3]\nThe New Los Angeles\n\nAfter returning from a summer tour in 2006 the band began working with producer Sergio J. Chavez (Motorhead/Helmet) for a third album, The New Los Angeles.[3] In January 2008[4] the band had supporting slots for Fu Manchu on their North American tour.[5] The New Los Angeles LP was released in Fall of 2008.[5]\n\nMastodon handpicked It's Casual to open for them in Athens, Georgia in October 2008, and the band played in-store at Criminal Records the day before in Atlanta, Georgia.[1][6]\n\nDuring this time Solis casually befriended the Los Angeles music video director Robert Schober, also known as Roboshobo.[7] Schober has previously directed videos for Mastodon, Metallica, and The B-52s.[8] He began listening to The New Los Angeles. Four months later he offered to film a music video for the album's title track.[7] The video was released in June 2009,[9] and first premiered at The Viper Room Lounge.[8]\n\nThe band has released a split 7&quot; from Basement Records with the hardcore band Bullet Treatment,[10] and has also announced production on a new album[6] titled The New Los Angeles II: Less Violence More Violins, which is purportedly inspired by the California education budget deficit.[5]\nShows\n\nThe band has performed with bands such as Story of the Year, Mastodon, High on Fire, Fireball Ministry, Zeke, 16, Visual Discrimination, and Mondo Generator.[2][9] They regularly play at venues such as The Viper Room and The Relax Bar, which is booked and managed by Solis as a metal venue in Hollywood.[11]\nStyle\n\nThe band has drawn favorable comparisons to Black Flag,[12] Motorhead, and Discharge,[9] and Solis has described the sound as &quot;L.A. hardcore&quot; and &quot;L.A. skate rock.&quot;[5] Themes include &quot;municipal outrage&quot; at freeways in Los Angeles and daily incidents and observations from living in the city.[5] Solis has also cited Kiss as one of the band's onstage influences, quoting &quot;For me, Kiss plays very loud and they engage with the audience,&quot; and similar to Kiss, they have a wall of amps behind them on stage as both a practical and visual part of the show\n\n\n\n\nArtist: It's Casual United States\n\nTitle: The New Los Angeles\n\nLabel: Friendly Hills Records Company United States\nGenre:  Hardcore Punk Rock\n\n01 The New Los Angeles\n02 L.A.P.D.\n03 Skate or Die\n04 Too Many Kids\n05 Impound\n06 We Accept E.B.T.\n07 Navigator\n08 The Pantry\n09 The Red Line\n10 EZ Pass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e004bc76dc4ae6f35b76cae1942120ef3fb74b7e","amp;dn":"It%27s+Casual+The+New+Los+Angeles+2007+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e004bc76dc4ae6f35b76cae1942120ef3fb74b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,4,188,118,220,74,230,243,91,118,202,225,148,33,32,239,63,183,75,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
