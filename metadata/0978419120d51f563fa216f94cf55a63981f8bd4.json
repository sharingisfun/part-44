Wii. Players choose to guide Mario, Luigi, or two versions of Toad through a variety of colorful worlds on another quest to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of Bowser. As always, the game worlds are filled with pitfalls and enemies, but players can fight back thanks to the new ice flower, which allows them to hurl snowballs, the new propeller mushroom, which lets gamers float through the air, and the new penguin suit, which provides surer footing in icy environments. The game makes use of a classic Super Mario Bros. control scheme, though propeller-suit actions and the spin jump incorporate the Wii Remote's motion sensitivity. Multiplayer action comes in both competitive and cooperative forms, letting up to four gamers interact with the environment and one another in a variety of helpful or hurtful ways.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Help Mario, Luigi, and Toad rescue Princess Peach one more time\n    Make use of new power-ups like the propeller mushroom and ice flower\n    Join three friends for a variety of competitive and cooperative modes\n\n\n          EnJoY iT ! :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0978419120d51f563fa216f94cf55a63981f8bd4","amp;dn":"New.Super.Mario.Bros.Wii.v1.02.PAL.Wii.2009-LaKiTu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0978419120d51f563fa216f94cf55a63981f8bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,120,65,145,32,213,31,86,63,162,22,249,76,245,90,99,152,31,139,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
