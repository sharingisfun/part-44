The\nconcerts would coincide with Universal Music (current\nowners of the A&amp;M label) re-releasing some material from\nthe band&amp;#039;s back catalog. The following statement was\nreleased on behalf of the band by a spokesperson at\nInterscope Geffen A&amp;M Records and posted on Sting&amp;#039;s\nofficial website: &quot;As the 30th anniversary of the first\nPolice single approaches, discussions have been underway\nas to how this will be commemorated. While we can confirm\nthat there will indeed be something special done to mark\nthe occasion, the depth of the band&amp;#039;s involvement still\nremains undetermined.&quot;\n\nOn January 22nd, 2007, the punk wave magazine Side-Line\nbroke the story that The Police would reunite for the\nGrammys, adding that the song performed would be\n&quot;Roxanne&quot;. All this information appeared to be correct.\nSide-Line also announced in its news coverage that The\nPolice were to embark on a massive tour bringing them to\ncities all over the world. Billboard magazine later on\nconfirmed the rumours, quoting Andy Summers who had\ndiscussed earlier in 2006 how the band could have\ncontinued post-Synchronicity: &quot;The more rational approach\nwould have been, &amp;#039;OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and\nlet&amp;#039;s get back together in two or three years,&amp;#039; &quot; he said.\n&quot;I&amp;#039;m certain we could have done that. Of course we could\nhave. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We\ncould have easily carried on, and we could probably still\nbe there. That wasn&amp;#039;t to be our fate. It went in another\nway. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour.&quot;\n\nInside sources have admitted that the group had in fact\nbegun tour rehearsals in Vancouver, British Columbia, and\nthat further details on the reunion tour would be\nannounced in February, including a performance at the 49th\nAnnual Grammy Awards on February 11, 2007. A local radio\nstation, Rock101, reported this information to the general\npublic on January 24, 2007. There have been numerous\nsightings of the group and their entourage in the\nVancouver area as expectation builds of a pending reunion\ntour.\n\nThe Police opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11\nFebruary 2007 in Los Angeles, California, announcing &quot;We\nare The Police and we&amp;#039;re back!&quot; before launching into\n&quot;Roxanne.&quot; A&amp;M Records, the band&amp;#039;s record company, is\npromoting the current 2007-2008 reunion tour as the 30th\nanniversary of the release of their first single and not\nindeed that of the band&amp;#039;s creation. ABC reported, &quot;This\nyear marks the 30th anniversary of the release of\n&amp;#039;Roxanne,&amp;#039; the single that broke the Police in the United\nStates.&quot; The single was released in April 1978.\n\nThe Police opened their Reunion Tour in Vancouver on May\n28 in front of 22,000 delighted fans at one of two nearly\nsold-out concerts. Opening with &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;\nSting, and bandmates Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers\nserved up two hours of blockbuster hits much to the\nexcitement of all who attended. The Police will be on tour\nfor approximately a year, beginning with North America and\neventually crossing over to Europe.\n\n*****NB: HALF SITES CALL THIS CD &quot;BEST OF&quot;; SOME &quot;GREATEST\nHITS&quot;.
