Featuring exclusive interviews with Alec Baldwin, Robert Kennedy Jr. and Donald Trump, the film takes viewers on a globe-spanning journey to a World Heritage site in Croatia; the extravagant desert city of Dubai, the explosion of new but supposedly illegal courses in China and back to the filmmaker's native Scotland, where Donald Trump continues his controversial building. \r\n\r\nThis sequel to You've Been Trumped (2011) investigates how big land developers like Donald Trump use golf as an excuse to build massive luxurious resorts on the expense of the locals and their ecosystem, and abuse natural resources.\r\n\r\nimdb.com/title/tt3714626/\r\n\r\nadangerousgamemovie.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93eb19e3615c89ab4b94ecfd5f5cd25003b74b3a","amp;dn":"A.Dangerous.Game.2014.tt3714626.Donald.Trump.x265.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93eb19e3615c89ab4b94ecfd5f5cd25003b74b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,235,25,227,97,92,137,171,75,148,236,253,95,92,210,80,3,183,75,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
