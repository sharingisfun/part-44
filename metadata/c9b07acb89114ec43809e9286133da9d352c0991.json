The crown prince is murdered by one of his brothers who then becomes emperor. Shi retreats to a monastery, perhaps to hide, perhaps to plan a coup. When his loyal troops as well as the princess he desires are slain, he seeks refuge in a remote, abandoned monastery where an aged abbot schools him with practical, earthy teachings. The emperor's forces pursue Shi: first a woman, then a general seek to overpower him with lust and might. Over the course of the film, the reds of battle give way to blues of meditation. \t \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b07acb89114ec43809e9286133da9d352c0991","amp;dn":"%E8%AA%98%E5%83%A7%2FTemptation+of+a+Monk%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b07acb89114ec43809e9286133da9d352c0991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,176,122,203,137,17,78,196,56,9,233,40,97,51,218,157,53,44,9,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
