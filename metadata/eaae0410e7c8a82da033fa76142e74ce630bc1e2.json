Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.\n\n @1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.\n @2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).\n @3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.\n\nPlus:\n\n @S. Special, usually dedicated to one artist.\n\nOnly the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.... Enjoy and keep the Indie spirit high.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlists 1111 (specs not accepted. Too Long?)\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaae0410e7c8a82da033fa76142e74ce630bc1e2","amp;dn":"Indie+Playlists+1111+Plus+%28Dutch+Treat+HQ+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaae0410e7c8a82da033fa76142e74ce630bc1e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,174,4,16,231,200,168,45,160,51,250,118,20,46,116,206,99,11,193,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
