It has more of a Southern rock sound than Zakk Wylde's other albums incorporating the likes of banjo, harmonica and mandolin.\n\nUpon its release, their one and only album was seen as an almost complete departure from the music Zakk was known for with Ozzy, but the album's dominant Southern rock sound proved to remain a prevalent influence on Zakk's own music up to and including the debut Black Label Society album Sonic Brew. Zakk's songwriting skills come to the forefront on the album; there is a great deal of variety and the songs themselves are very dynamic, with a very loose jam-band feel to a number of them, namely &quot;Shine On&quot; and &quot;Toe'n the Line.&quot;\n\nBoth &quot;Losin' Your Mind&quot; and &quot;Horse Called War&quot; were released as promotional singles with accompanying music videos, whilst &quot;Troubled Wine&quot; was also released as a promo single but without a video.\n\nThe album was reissued in 1999 on Spitfire Records with a bonus disc of rare and unreleased material.\t\t\n\n\nRE-Upped for better Quality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43a66628bec61003f758bc0602e8d1919d2a680a","amp;dn":"Pride+%26amp%3B+Glory+RE-UP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43a66628bec61003f758bc0602e8d1919d2a680a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,166,102,40,190,198,16,3,247,88,188,6,2,232,209,145,157,42,104,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
