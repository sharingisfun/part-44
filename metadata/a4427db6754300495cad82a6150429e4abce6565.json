He played all the instruments and sang all the songs in Dylan's breathy, nasal twang. He registered a domain name, dylanhearsawho.com, and in February [of 2007] posted his seven tracks online, accompanied by suitably Photoshopped album artwork.\n\nThen Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the La Jolla, Calif., firm that publishes the works of the late Theodor Geisel, heard &quot;Dylan Hears a Who.&quot; Only two weeks after word of the site began spreading, Ryan got a cease-and-desist demand from the Seuss lawyers, who said the site and songs infringed the company's copyrights and trademarks.\n\nRyan--best known as the coauthor of &quot;Recording the Beatles,&quot; a meticulous investigation of every track, take and song the group committed to vinyl--was face-to-face with a company that zealously guards its intellectual property.\n\n-- http://www.salon.com/2007/04/13/dylan_seuss\n\n1.
