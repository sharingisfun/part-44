Shermer argues that while science is the best lens through which to view the world, it is often difficult to decipher where valid science leaves off and borderland, or &quot;fuzzy&quot; science begins. To solve this dilemma, he looks at a range of topics that put this boundary line in high relief. For instance, he debunks the many &quot;theories of everything&quot; that try to reduce the complexity of the world to a single principle. He examines the work of Darwin and Freud, explaining why one is among the great scientists in history, while the other has become nothing more than a historical curiosity. And he reveals how scientists themselves can be led astray, as seen in the infamous Piltdown hoax--the set of ancient hominid bones discovered in England that after decades turned out to be an enormous forgery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94639e9a5d0a239da553ddf8cc90cad7b8610233","amp;dn":"The+Borderlands+of+Science+-+Michael+Shermer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94639e9a5d0a239da553ddf8cc90cad7b8610233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,99,158,154,93,10,35,157,165,83,221,248,204,144,202,215,184,97,2,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
