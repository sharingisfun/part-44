From 1969 are James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander in The Great White Hope and Art Carney in Lovers, and other performances include Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack in Lettice and Lovage (1990), John Lithgow and B.D. Wong in M. Butterfly (1988), Joan Allen and Peter Friedman in The Heidi Chronicles (1988), and Joe Mantegna and Ron Silver in Speed-the-Plow (1988). The performances aren&amp;#039;t specifically organized by date or performer, but the collection concludes with four excerpts from August Wilson works followed by three Shakespearean works. The excerpts are brief, lasting 2-3 minutes each, and even though each segment is introduced by a narrator, this format clearly works better for musicals than it does for plays. Regardless, it remains a rare chance to see stage performances that for the most part are not available on home video. Collectors who already own the three musical volumes, however, will have to weigh how badly they want The Plays when they consider mostly duplicating their purchase with the Broadway&amp;#039;s Lost Treasures Collection. --David Horiuchi \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9897723106f117e5c9d5448b31d26654a78166","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+the+Tony+Awards+-+The+Plays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9897723106f117e5c9d5448b31d26654a78166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,152,151,114,49,6,241,23,229,201,213,68,139,49,210,102,84,167,129,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
