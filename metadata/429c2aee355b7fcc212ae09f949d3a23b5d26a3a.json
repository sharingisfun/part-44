They don't take things as far outside as they did then, but still soar and glide while pianist William Henderson, bassist Ray Drummond, and drummer Idris Muhammad fill in underneath them. ~ Ron Wynn, AMG\n\nThe biggest surprise of all is the final track - a slow dirge based on the spiritual &quot;going home&quot; -worth the price just for this one cut - completely different to anything i have heard Pharoah record before - and i have over 30 albums under his leadership.  I recommend you buy this cd wholeheartedly ~ A Customer\n\nOne of those albums you'd like to love more than you actually do, Pharoah Sanders' &quot;Shukuru&quot; is noteworthy as being the album that reunited Sanders with vocalist Leon Thomas, who sang on some of Sanders' most indearing and powerful compositions-- among them the legendary &quot;The Creator Has a Masterplan&quot;. \n\nThomas actually only joins the band (William Henderson on keyboard, Ray Drummond on bass and Idris Muhammed on drums) on two tracks-- &quot;Mas in Brooklyn (Highlife)&quot; and &quot;Sun Song&quot;. The former gets a full calyso reading complete with steel drum sounds and chanted vocals traded between Sanders and Thomas. It's a lot of fun, but by and large, throwaway. The latter is one of the true gems on the album-- a pretty ballad that serves as both a launching point for Sanders' best balladry and Thomas' vocal, with the latter soaring in his upper register wordlessly between verses intoned in his trademark baritone. It's by and large simply stunning. ~ Michael Stack\n\nPersonnel:\nPharoah Sanders (Tenor Saxophone and Voice) \nLeon Thomas (Vocals)\nWilliam Henderson (Piano and Voices) \nRay Drummond (Double Bass) \nIdris Muhammad (Drums) \n\nPharoah Sanders - Shukuru Tracks:\n01 Shukuru (Pharoah Sanders) 5:50 \n02 Body And Soul (Frank Eyton/Johnny Green/Edward Heyman/Robert Sour) 7:35 \n03 Mas In Brooklyn (Highlife) (Francisco Linger) 3:43 \n04 Sun Song (Leon Thomas) 6:07 \n05 Too Young To Go Steady (Harold Adamson/Jimmy McHugh) 5:25 \n06 Jitu (Pharoah Sanders) 5:47 \n07 For Big George (Pharoah Sanders/Leon Thomas) 8:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429c2aee355b7fcc212ae09f949d3a23b5d26a3a","amp;dn":"Pharoah+Sanders+-+Shukuru+%281981%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429c2aee355b7fcc212ae09f949d3a23b5d26a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,156,42,238,53,91,127,204,33,42,224,159,148,157,58,35,181,210,106,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
