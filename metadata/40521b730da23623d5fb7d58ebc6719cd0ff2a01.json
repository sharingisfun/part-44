WE SHALL REMAIN represents an unprecedented collaboration between Native and non-Native filmmakers and involves Native advisors and scholars at all levels of the project.\n\n01 - After the Mayflower\n02 - Tecumseh's Vision\n03 - Trail of Tears\n04 - Geronimo\n05 - Wounded Knee\n\nEXTRAS\n\nApache War Dance\nExtra 01\nExtra 02\nExtra 03\nExtra 04\nNative Languages\nPreviews - Making of\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40521b730da23623d5fb7d58ebc6719cd0ff2a01","amp;dn":"We+Shall+Remain+-+America+Through+Native+Eyes+%5BPBS%5D+.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40521b730da23623d5fb7d58ebc6719cd0ff2a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,82,27,115,13,162,54,35,213,251,125,88,235,198,113,156,208,255,42,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
