All situations are discussed, including overcast and sunny days, backlighting and flare, window light, daylight studios, natural reflectors, and studio lighting at home, offering a plethora of ideas for finding, diffusing, and creating light. As photographers learn the advantages of shooting with available lightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no set up, more spontaneity, more time to concentrate on the subject, and the ability to capture preexisting relationshipsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they not only become better photographers but gain confidence and an increased awareness of their artistic medium.\nAbout the Author\n\nDon Marr is a portrait photographer and a photography instructor.
