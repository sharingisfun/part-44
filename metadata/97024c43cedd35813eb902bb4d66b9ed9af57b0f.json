Her ex-boy friend, Stuart, lives above her apartment and finds this space near the Brooklyn Bridge where there is a gap in time. He goes back to the eighteen hundreds and takes pictures of the place. Leopold, a man living in the 1870&amp;#039;s, was puzzled by Stuart&amp;#039;s tiny camera and decides to follow him and they both ended up in this century. Leopold is clueless about his new surroundings. He gets help and insights from Charlie who thinks that Leopold is an actor who is always in character. Leopold is a highly intelligent man and tries his best to learn and even improve the modern conveniences that he encounters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97024c43cedd35813eb902bb4d66b9ed9af57b0f","amp;dn":"Kate.%26.Leopold%5B2001%5DDvDrip%5BEng.Subs%5D-kirklestat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97024c43cedd35813eb902bb4d66b9ed9af57b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,2,76,67,206,221,53,129,62,185,2,187,77,102,185,237,154,245,123,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
