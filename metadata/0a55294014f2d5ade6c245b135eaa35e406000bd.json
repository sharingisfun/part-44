It was the band&amp;#039;s ninth single release in the United Kingdom (the third taken from their second LP Songs from the Big Chair) and seventh UK Top 25 chart hit, peaking at #2 in April 1985. In the USA, it was the lead single from the album and gave the band their first ever Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit on June 8, 1985, remaining there for two weeks. The song has since become the pinnacle of Tears for Fears&amp;#039; chart success, its endurance allowing it to accumulate over two million radio broadcasts by 1994, according to BMI.\n\nThe promotional clip for &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, filmed in early 1985, was the third Tears for Fears clip directed by famed music video producer Nigel Dick. It features Curt Smith driving an antique Austin-Healey 3000 sports car around various Southern California locales, including Salton Sea and Cabazon. Interspersed with these clips are shots of the full band performing the song in a London studio. Along with the clip for &quot;Shout&quot;, the &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; video had a big hand in helping break Tears for Fears in America, due to its heavy amount of play on music video pioneer MTV.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a55294014f2d5ade6c245b135eaa35e406000bd","amp;dn":"Tears+For+Fears+-+Everybody+Wants+To+Rule+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a55294014f2d5ade6c245b135eaa35e406000bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,85,41,64,20,242,213,173,230,194,69,177,53,234,163,94,64,96,0,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
