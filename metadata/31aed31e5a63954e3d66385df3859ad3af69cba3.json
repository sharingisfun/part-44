Mostly, it prepares the listener for nonstop offensive humor or an otherwise edgy act that will draw out laughs from highly uncomfortable topics. Daryl WrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, however funny, may be ever-so-slightly mistitled.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based comedian has a strong start when the live portion of the album begins. The actual opening features his closing joke remixed into a house music track. (The album also ends with music). Confusing, to say the least. When the music is over, Wright tackles race, class and sexuality. In fact, early on he pleads with the audience to not allow Ã¢â‚¬Å“white guiltÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to mess up the show, reassuring them, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do any of yaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll still own slaves? Then what are you guilty about?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nQuick to include everybody, he throws in a brilliant race question to the Mexicans in the audience: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll just do the paperwork and just be legal? It comes in Spanish. What the fuck donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Everyone in the audience is his Ã¢â‚¬Å“dogÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as he creates a vibe similar to that of hanging with friends in your basement.\n\nHis jokes are posed to us in simple, yet hilarious, questions that make the strange familiar and the familiar strange. But just when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re getting into the socio-political commentary, the album takes a misleading (or maybe brave?) trajectory. An act usually begins with personal musings that lead up to headier topics. Wright begins with race and class and then suddenly steps back into a story about getting kicked off BET (which like him, I thought, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know black guys could get kicked off BETÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and another story about him being high during a police chase. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re set-up for social issues youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re blindsided by seemingly misplaced stories. Once you realign yourself for the change, though, Wright provides his own skillful spin on played-out premises. Ever hear the one that starts with, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Men and women are different?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31aed31e5a63954e3d66385df3859ad3af69cba3","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Daryl+Wright+-+Wildly+Inappropriate+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31aed31e5a63954e3d66385df3859ad3af69cba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,174,211,30,90,99,149,78,61,102,56,93,243,133,154,211,175,105,203,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
