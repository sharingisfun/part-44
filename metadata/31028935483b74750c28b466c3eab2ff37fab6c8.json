This involved both agricultural work, interacting with members of an aging rural community, and competing in challenges involving agrarian or domestic tasks. As the show's popularity grew, the cast and crew began work to make their filming location a sustainable site for agritourism, enter produce in food competition, and promote environmentally conscious farming. Some of the products were sold within the local community, to the general public, or distributed as gifts.\n\nThe G7 girls initially included Narsha of Brown Eyed Girls, Sunhwa of Secret, Hyuna of 4Minute, Hyomin of T-ara, Sunny and Yuri of Girls' Generation, and Hara of Kara.\n\nOn Friday, May 14, 2010, the PD of the show Kim Ho-sang announced that Sunny, Yuri, and Hyuna would be leaving the show due to scheduling conflicts with their respective groups' overseas promotions. Their replacements were decided through private auditions with members of other K-pop girl groups.\n\nOn May 30, it was confirmed that After School's Jooyeon, f(x)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Victoria and Kim Sori will become the three new members of G7 on Invincible Youth. Kim Jong-min (of Koyote) also became a semi-permanent member for a month under the moniker of being a &quot;Variety show mentor&quot; for the new members.\n\nOn the August 27th episode, it was announced that Kim Tae-woo will be taking a temporary leave of absence due to a surgery he is to receive for his throat. He vowed to come back to the show as soon as he makes a full recovery. Starting episode 44, Song Eun-yi filled in as a semi-permanent MC in Kim Tae-woo's absence. On December 8, 2010, it was revealed that Invincible Youth finished recording their finale episode. They had filmed for over one year, since October 2009.\n\nIn an interview with Star News on December 10, production director (PD) Kim Sang-ho said, &quot;We're not discontinuing the show because of low viewer ratings. There has been a lot of conflicting schedules due to girl groups like KARA expanding their activities overseas. It was difficult to take out some of the fixed members, so we decided to end season one for now. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of trust being placed on the worth of the Invincible Youth brand. After discussions with other producers, everyone agreed to end season one and go ahead with season two next year.&quot;\n\nSeason 1 Slogan: Ã¬Â²Â­Ã¬Â¶ËœÃ¬ï¿½â‚¬ Ã¬Â§â‚¬Ã¬Â§â‚¬ Ã¬â€¢Å Ã«Å â€Ã«â€¹Â¤~ Ã¬Â²Â­Ã¬Â¶Ëœ~ Ã«Â¶Ë†Ã­Å’Â¨ (Youth Don't Lose!
