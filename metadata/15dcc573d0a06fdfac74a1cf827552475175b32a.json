To achieve and establish this plan, they kidnap and replace the U.S. President, discredit the head of the Z.O.W.I.E. intelligence agency, and commandeer a nuclear-armed space platform, all directed from Fabulous Face, a women's beauty farm in the Virgin Islands. Circumstances compel ex-secret agent Derek Flint to help his ex-boss, and so uncover the conspiracy.\n\nActors James Coburn and Lee J. Cobb reprise their roles as &quot;Derek Flint&quot; and spy chief &quot;Lloyd C. Cramden&quot;, Flint's ex-boss. The ad campaign featured a classic piece of movie poster artwork by Bob Peak.\n\nThis film and Caprice with Doris Day were the last films made in CinemaScope, with Fox and other studios moving to Panavision and other widescreen processes. The title is a play on the phrase &quot;in like Flynn.&quot;[3]\n\nContents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15dcc573d0a06fdfac74a1cf827552475175b32a","amp;dn":"I+lIKE+FLINT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15dcc573d0a06fdfac74a1cf827552475175b32a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,220,197,115,208,160,111,223,172,116,161,207,130,117,82,71,81,117,179,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
