Stewart plays John Royer, an ex-newspaper reporter with a backhand knowledge of Malaya, and Tracy plays a criminal named Carnaghan, doing time in Alcatraz for smuggling. They are brought together for an undercover assignment -- to smuggle a large shipment of rubber out of Japanese-held territory in Malaya and deliver the tonnage to awaiting U.S. ships. Carnaghan and Royer plod through the jungles and have to deal with several unscrupulous contacts including a man calling himself The Dutchman (Sydney Greenstreet), a helpful FBI agent named Kellar (John Hodiak), and a sneaky Japanese officer by the name of Colonel Tomura (Richard Loo). \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041622/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041622/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nRichard Thorpe\n\n\n\n        Spencer Tracy\t ... \tCarnaghan\n\n\tJames Stewart\t... \tJohn Royer\n\tValentina Cortese.. \tLuana (as Valentina Cortesa)\n\n\tSydney Greenstreet ... \tThe Dutchman\n\t\n\tJohn Hodiak\t... \tKellar\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:34:52\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 592x448  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 973 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 58 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62f4373fe75d7487ab91caa9d5998c5f8b7ee9e5","amp;dn":"Malaya+%281949%29+Spencer+Tracy%2CJames+Stewart+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62f4373fe75d7487ab91caa9d5998c5f8b7ee9e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,244,55,63,231,93,116,135,171,145,202,169,213,153,140,95,139,126,233,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
