Here's our show:\n\nHOUSE RULES: Today's most famous successful rule breakers are the &quot;sharing economy&quot; companies like Uber and Airbnb. They keep gaining happy customers but most everywhere they go, established companies get mad because they must obey the rules. Some cities ban Airbnb. We sent producer Rikki Ratliff to visit one.\n\nSTREET VANDAL ATTACKS CLINTON HQ: Conservative street artist Sabo plastered these posters outside of Hillary's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn:\n\nUsually &quot;street art&quot; is associated with the left but Sabo defies that rule and says he wants to be &quot;mean, nasty, and just as bad as Bill Maher.&quot;\n\nRULING THE NEW MEDIA: You used to need an agent or record company to become a Hollywood hotshot, but now teenagers found a way around the traditional rule-makers and make millions of dollars posting their own videos on YouTube.\n\nRULEBREAKER AWARDS: Entrepreneur Mike Michalowicz honors innovators who defy convention by giving cash prizes to winners of what he calls &quot;The RuleBreaker Awards.&quot;\n\nMY TAKE: The rule breakers on this show have done great things, but they're nothing compared to the original rule breakers, our Founding Fathers. They broke rules to give us our rights. Today we need to rebel again, no longer against kings or the church, but against the regulatory state.\n\nAirs Friday at 8PM ET on Fox Business Network\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.08.21.Rule.Breakers.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.159\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea0c8f37c4ad25e5a2c76e19afeed09131f22981","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.08.21.Rule.Breakers.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea0c8f37c4ad25e5a2c76e19afeed09131f22981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,12,143,55,196,173,37,229,162,199,110,25,175,238,208,145,49,242,41,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
