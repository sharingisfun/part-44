While the band&amp;#039;s influences are clear and undeniable, Snow Patrol are no mere imitators. Instead, they display a confidence and a sense of fun that has made them one of the most successful bands to emerge from Scotland&amp;#039;s fecund indie scene. \n\nMad for sadness? Then Northern Irish four-piece Snow Patrol could be the band for you. Fully paid-up members of the generation of youthful Brit-rockers--see also JJ72 and Muse--Snow Patrol twin their histrionic-heavy guitar-fuzz to the vulnerable, reed-thin vocals of a teen-angstified frontman. But ignore lead singer Gary Lightbody when he hisses that he&amp;#039;s &quot;never gonna fall in love again&quot; on the opening track of the same name; When It&amp;#039;s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up is an album about giving your heart away, feeling it break and desperately trying to reassemble it before the next emotional meltdown. Perversely, some of this record&amp;#039;s greatest moments find amps turned down and emotions laid desperately bare: the acoustic &quot;Make Love To Me Forever&quot; and the love-laid-to-rest lament of &quot;If I&amp;#039;d Ever Found The Right Words To Say&quot;. But that&amp;#039;s not to say that the ballsy pop songs--see &quot;Ask Me How I Am&quot;, the sound of a harmony-laden Sebadoh playing hip-hop through a detuned radio--don&amp;#039;t make the grade. And when it&amp;#039;s all over? They may have been casualties in the Wars Of Love, but as Lightbody whispers &quot;we won&amp;#039;t get much sleep&quot; on the closing &quot;Firelight&quot;, you know that--like you--Snow Patrol are ready to flip the record and live it all again\n\nQ Magazine, April, 2001 ...pretty special... \n\nMagnet (9-10/01, p.114) - &quot;...Like a more new-wave Sebadoh....rocking triumphantly...&quot; \n\nEnjoy! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f15a68b10f7815a4a6cb23edd8ac94a06e88970f","amp;dn":"Snow+Patrol+-+When+It%5C%27s+All+Over+We+Still+Have+To","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f15a68b10f7815a4a6cb23edd8ac94a06e88970f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,90,104,177,15,120,21,164,166,203,35,237,216,172,148,160,110,136,151,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
