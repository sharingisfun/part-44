Far behind him \n\nlies a boyhood cut violently short by his familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nslaughter, when the forces of madness and hate swept \n\nour world after decadent excesses led to civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\ndownfall. Somewhere ahead of him rests the only chance \n\nto beat back the minions of evil that are systematically \n\nkilling and enslaving the last remnants of humanity. \n\nNavigating the scarred and poisoned landscape that once \n\nwas America and guided by a powerful talisman, Logan has \n\nsworn an oath to seek out a remarkable being born of magic, \n\npossessed of untold abilities, and destined to lead the\n\nfinal fight against darkness.\n\n=============================================\n\nThe Elves of Cintra:\n\n\nAcross the ruined landscape that is AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€œhopelessly \n\npoisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon \n\narmies bent on exterminating all mortal lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€œtwo pilgrims \n\nhave been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. \n\nLogan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a \n\nragged band of street urchins and the being known as \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“the gypsy morph,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who is both mortal and magical, and \n\ndestined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, \n\nAngel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her \n\nfrom the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret \n\nplace untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blightÃ¢â‚¬â€œa \n\nplace where the race of Elves has dwelled since before \n\nman existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the \n\nWord swarm the ravening forces of the Void. \n\n\n=============================================\n\nThe Gypsy Morph:\n\nEighty years into the future, the United States is \n\na no-manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-land: its landscape blighted by chemical \n\nwarfare, pollution, and plague; its government collapsed; \n\nits citizens adrift, desperate, fighting to stay alive. \n\nIn fortified compounds, survivors hold the line against \n\nwandering predators, rogue militias, and hideous mutations \n\nspawned from the toxic environment, while against them \n\nall stands an enemy neither mortal nor merciful: demons \n\nand their minions bent on slaughtering and subjugating \n\nthe last of humankind.\n\n=============================================\n\nEffloresce~TPB.\n\n=============================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b16c0f7869a95fbb28a0208d31252b2da9eb3e6","amp;dn":"Genesis+of+Shannara+-+Terry+Brooks+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b16c0f7869a95fbb28a0208d31252b2da9eb3e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,22,192,247,134,154,149,251,178,138,2,8,211,18,82,178,218,158,179,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
