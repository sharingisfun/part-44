She faces a host of fiends, quickly realizing more arcane forces drive the bouts and their frenzied combatants, enhanced with a powerful, corrupting essence, firmly stacking the odds against Vampirella surviving the night.\n\nVampirella: Red Room #2\nFacing one super-charged fiend after another in a series of brutal death matches slowly takes it toll. A bruised, bloodied and broken Vampirella soon discovers a far more sinister fate awaiting her. After an evening of fighting to stay alive, the night has only pain and depravity in store at Rigger's nearby compound.\n\nVampirella: Red Room #3\nTrapped in a labyrinth of passages in the bowels of Rigger's compound, Vampirella stumbles onto an ancient creature locked away from the world, once supremely lethal and cunning, now decayed in mind and body. Her only chance to survive the night lies in rousing the legendary beast to lash back at its torturers.\n\nVampirella: The Red Room #4\nHaving unleashed a mighty fiend of the Old World upon its former masters, Vampirella has a catastrophe on her hands, as the compound is engulfed in a conflagration, with hideous killers roaming the night. One by one, she'll battle a host of monsters to keep Hell from overcoming Arkansas.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7216775/Vampirella_-_The_Red_Room_001_(2012)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7216775/Vampirella_-_The_Red_Room_001_(2012)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7643a8f3914e0e4fa218cc8dda639c7ce052d1a8","amp;dn":"Vampirella%3A+The+Red+Room+%232-4+%282012%29+%5BDynamite%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7643a8f3914e0e4fa218cc8dda639c7ce052d1a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,67,168,243,145,78,14,79,162,24,204,141,218,99,156,124,224,82,209,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
