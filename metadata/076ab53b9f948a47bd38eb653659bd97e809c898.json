She rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and later as a solo artist. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Joplin number 46 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and number 28 on its 2008 list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time\n\nIn 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the psychedelic rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company, a band that had gained some renown among the nascent hippie community in Haight-Ashbury. She was recruited to join the group by Chet Helms, a promoter who had known her in Texas and who at the time was managing Big Brother. Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966.  Her first public performance with them was at the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco. Due to persistent persuading by keyboardist and close friend Stephen Ryder, Joplin avoided drug use for several weeks, enjoining bandmate Dave Getz to promise that using needles would not be allowed in their rehearsal space or in the communal apartment where they lived.  When a visitor to the apartment injected drugs in front of Joplin, she angrily reminded Getz that he had broken his promise.  A San Francisco concert from that summer was recorded and released in the 1984 album Cheaper Thrills.\nOn August 23, 1966  during a four week engagement in Chicago, the group signed a deal with independent label Mainstream Records.  They recorded tracks in a Chicago recording studio, but the label owner Bob Shad refused to pay their airfare back to San Francisco. Shortly after the five band members drove from Chicago to Northern California with very little money, they moved with the Grateful Dead to a house in Lagunitas, California. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drugs.\nIn early 1967, Joplin met Country Joe McDonald of the group Country Joe and the Fish. The pair lived together as a couple for a few months.  Joplin and Big Brother began playing clubs in San Francisco, at the Fillmore West, Winterland and the Avalon Ballroom. They also played at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, as well as in Seattle, Washington, Vancouver, British Columbia, the Psychedelic Supermarket in Boston, Massachusetts and the Golden Bear Club in Huntington Beach, California \nThe band's debut album was released by Columbia Records in August 1967, shortly after the group's breakthrough appearance in June at the Monterey Pop Festival. Two songs from Big Brother's set at Monterey were filmed. &quot;Combination of the Two&quot; and a version of Big Mama Thornton's &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; appeared in D.A. Pennebaker's documentary Monterey Pop. The film captured Cass Elliot in the crowd silently mouthing &quot;Wow!&quot; during Joplin's performance.[7]\nIn November 1967, the group parted ways with Chet Helms and signed with top artist manager Albert Grossman. Up to this point, Big Brother had performed mainly in California, but had gained national prominence with their Monterey performance. On February 16, 1968,  the group began its first East Coast tour in Philadelphia, and the following day gave their first performance in New York City at the Anderson Theater.  On April 7, 1968, the last day of their East Coast tour, Joplin and Big Brother performed with Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, Joni Mitchell, Richie Havens, Paul Butterfield, and Elvin Bishop at the &quot;Wake for Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; concert in New York.\nDuring the spring of 1968, Joplin and Big Brother made their nationwide television debut on The Dick Cavett Show, an ABC daytime variety show hosted by Dick Cavett. Later, she made three appearances on the primetime Cavett program. During this time, the band was billed as &quot;Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company,&quot;  although the media coverage given to Joplin incurred resentment among the other members of the band.  The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a &quot;star trip,&quot; while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them. \nTIME magazine called Joplin &quot;probably the most powerful singer to emerge from the white rock movement,&quot; and Richard Goldstein, in Vogue magazine, wrote that Joplin was &quot;the most staggering leading woman in rock... she slinks like tar, scowls like war... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave... Janis Joplin can sing the chic off any listener.&quot; \nBig Brother's second album, Cheap Thrills, featured a cover design by counterculture cartoonist Robert Crumb. Although Cheap Thrills sounded as if it was mostly &quot;live,&quot; only one track (&quot;Ball and Chain&quot;) was actually recorded live; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings.  The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a cocktail glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song &quot;Turtle Blues.&quot; With the documentary film Monterey Pop released in late 1968, the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career. \nCheap Thrills, which gave the band a breakthrough hit single, &quot;Piece of My Heart,&quot; reached the number one spot on the Billboard charts eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks. The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release. Live at Winterland '68, recorded at the Winterland Ballroom on April 12 and 13, 1968, featured Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company at the height of their mutual career working through a selection of tracks from their albums.\nThe band made another East Coast tour during July-August 1968, performing at the Columbia Records convention in Puerto Rico and the Newport Folk Festival. After returning to San Francisco for two hometown shows at the Palace of Fine Arts Festival on August 31 and September 1, Joplin announced that she would be leaving Big Brother. The group continued touring through the fall and Joplin gave her last official performance with Big Brother at a Family Dog benefit on December 1, 1968. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:076ab53b9f948a47bd38eb653659bd97e809c898","amp;dn":"Janis+Joplin-1963-1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"076ab53b9f948a47bd38eb653659bd97e809c898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,106,181,59,159,148,138,71,189,56,235,101,54,89,189,151,232,9,200,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
