The album reached #4 on the Australian album charts and remained in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks,[2] eventually selling over 280 000 copies (five times platinum).\n\nThe title track, written by lead singer James Reyne contains the invented word \\&quot;dorseted\\&quot;:\n\n    \\&quot;People aren\\'t used to hearing \\'Dorseted\\', and it\\'s not actually a word - it\\'s from the Dorset Gardens - I\\'m trying to be as suburban as possible, and it rhymed with \\'corseted\\'.\\&quot; - James Reyne, 2003[3]\n\nVarious band members were involved in songwriting, often with relatives or former bandmates. Rhythm guitarist Brad Robinson\\'s father James Robinson was a Federal Arbitration Court Justice and co-wrote two songs for this album.[4] Reyne\\'s bandmate from Spiff Rouch, Mark Hudson co-wrote their first single, \\&quot;Beautiful People\\&quot; (1979).[5] \\&quot;Downhearted\\&quot; was written by Bill McDonough and his bandmates from The Flatheads, Guy McDonough (his brother, who later joined the Crawl) and Sean Higgins.[5] Producer, David Briggs (Little River Band guitarist), co-wrote \\&quot;Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama\\&quot; with Reyne.[5]\n\nThe album was re-released in 1992 in CD format (see cover right below), and as a 2-CD set with follow-up album Sirocco in 1996.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. \\&quot;My Coffee\\'s Gone Cold\\&quot; (Simon Binks) - 3:29\n   2. \\&quot;Man Crazy\\&quot; (James Reyne) - 3:39\n   3. \\&quot;Way I\\'ve Been\\&quot; (Brad Robinson, James Robinson) - 2:17\n   4. \\&quot;Chinese Eyes\\&quot; (James Reyne, Simon Binks) - 3:01\n   5. \\&quot;Downhearted\\&quot; (Sean Higgins, Guy McDonough, William \\'Bill\\' McDonough) - 3:09\n   6. \\&quot;Beautiful People\\&quot; (James Reyne, Mark Hudson) - 2:56\n   7. \\&quot;Indisposed\\&quot; (Brad Robinson, James Robinson, James Reyne, William \\'Bill\\' McDonough) - 4:04\n   8. \\&quot;Walk My Way\\&quot; (James Reyne, Brad Robinson)- 2:44\n   9. \\&quot;The Boys Light Up\\&quot; (James Reyne) - 4:41\n  10. \\&quot;Boot Hill\\&quot; (James Reyne, Simon Binks) - 2:36\n  11. \\&quot;Red Guitar\\&quot; (Simon Binks) - 3:19\n  12. \\&quot;Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama\\&quot; (James Reyne, David Briggs) - 2:30\n\n320kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ead16808015cbb1b3e97121e4cf81b0e757572a","amp;dn":"Australian+Crawl+-+The+Boys+Light+Up+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ead16808015cbb1b3e97121e4cf81b0e757572a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,173,22,128,128,21,203,177,179,233,113,33,228,207,129,176,231,87,87,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
