Part 1 begins with an overview of a set of real numbers: rational and irrational. This is accompanied by a discussion of arithmetic rules, inequalities, absolute values. Doing this, the authors, in a clever way, introduce elements of a set theory using Cantor's approach. This is followed by the definition of a function and discussion of operations on functions. From this they move to differential and integral calculus and their applications.\r\n\r\nPart 2 contains rigorous proofs of theorems from Part 1. In particular, they introduce the order structure on a real line using axioms of an ordered field. It is worth mentioning that Part 2 contains elements of topology obviously on real line and a good insight on convex functions. The convex functions relate Analysis to linear spaces equipped with norm. Finally, to close Part 2 the authors supply a number of Appendices, among them Appendices on logic, set theory and Peano axioms.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, Volume I contains 360 problems with complete solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55012f779f2434a4a34718bc3255de751ecd5d0a","amp;dn":"A+Course+in+Analysis+-+Volume+1+-+Niels+Jacob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55012f779f2434a4a34718bc3255de751ecd5d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,1,47,119,159,36,52,164,163,71,24,188,50,85,222,117,30,205,93,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
