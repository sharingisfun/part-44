In the past, conservative women worked hard to nurture their homes, their churches and their communities, committing their time, talents and resources to the betterment of all concerned. Wherever there was a need, they worked together to meet itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and that was enough. Not anymore. Thanks to the ongoing efforts of the progressive media and the liberal political leadership, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s American political and social language has completely changed. Our God-given, constitutionally protected rights are being threatened on multiple fronts. Our children are being taught ideas we would never want them exposed to. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to take a stand. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to ROAR!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa309527d84786b9346af141e6a542bc6bcc450","amp;dn":"Roar%3A+The+New+Conservative+Woman+Speaks+Out+Scottie+Nell+Hughes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa309527d84786b9346af141e6a542bc6bcc450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,163,9,82,125,132,120,107,147,70,175,20,30,106,84,43,198,188,196,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
