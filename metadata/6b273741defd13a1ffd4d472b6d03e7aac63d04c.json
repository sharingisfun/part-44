Under the Roman Empire, a man who committed a certain kind of crime was banned from society and all of his rights as a citizen were revoked. He thus became a &quot;homo sacer&quot; (sacred man). In consequence, he could be killed by anybody -- while his life on the other hand was deemed &quot;sacred&quot;, so he could not be sacrificed in a ritual ceremony.\n\nRoman law no longer applied to someone deemed a Homo sacer, although they would remain &quot;under the spell&quot; of law. Agamben defines it as &quot;human life...included in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be killed)&quot;. Homo sacer was therefore excluded from law itself, while being included at the same time. This figure is the exact mirror image of the sovereign (Basileus) -- a king, emperor, or president -- who stands, on the one hand, within law (so he can be condemned, e.g., for treason, as a natural person) and outside of the law (since as a body politic he has power to suspend law for an indefinite time).\n\n(...)\n\nSince its origins, Agamben notes, law has had the power of defining what &quot;bare life&quot; (zoe, as opposed to bios: qualified life) is by making this exclusive operation, while at the same time gaining power over it by making it the subject of political control. The power of law to actively separate &quot;political&quot; beings (citizens) from &quot;bare life&quot; (bodies) has carried on from Antiquity to Modernity -- from, literally, Aristotle to Auschwitz. Aristotle, as Agamben notes, constitutes political life via a simultaneous inclusion and exclusion of &quot;bare life&quot;: as Aristotle says, man is an animal born to life (zen), but existing with regard to the good life (eu zen) which can be achieved through politics. Bare life, in this ancient conception of politics, is that which must be transformed, via the State, into the &quot;good life&quot;; that is, bare life is that which is supposedly excluded from the higher aims of the state, yet is included precisely so that it may be transformed into this &quot;good life&quot;. Sovereignty, then, is conceived from ancient times as a state of exception. According to Agamben, biopower, which takes the bare lives of the citizens into its political calculations, may be more marked in the modern state, but has essentially existed since the beginnings of sovereignty in the West, since this structure of ex-ception is essential to the core concept of sovereignty.\n\nAgamben would continue to expand the theory of the state of exception first introduced in &quot;Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life&quot;, ultimately leading &quot;State of Exception&quot; in 2005. During 2003, he delivered a lecture describing the eclipse that politics has undergone. Instead of leaving a space between law and life, the space where human action is possible, the space that used to constitute politics, he argues that politics has ÃƒÂ¢??contaminated itself with lawÃƒÂ¢?? in the state of exception. Because ÃƒÂ¢??only human action is able to cut the relationship between violence and lawÃƒÂ¢??, it becomes increasingly difficult within the state of exception for humanity to act against the State.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Agamben&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b273741defd13a1ffd4d472b6d03e7aac63d04c","amp;dn":"Agamben+-+Homo+Sacer.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b273741defd13a1ffd4d472b6d03e7aac63d04c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,39,55,65,222,253,19,161,255,212,212,114,182,208,62,122,172,99,208,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
