This \nalbum is part of the &quot;Perception&quot; box set, which enclosed all six studio \nalbums from The Doors, with bonus DVDs and a enhanced audio, specifically \nremastered for this box.\n\nReview by Bruce Eder (allmusicguide)\nA tremendous debut album, and indeed one of the best first-time outings in rock \nhistory, introducing the band's fusion of rock, blues, classical, \njazz, and poetry with a knockout punch. The lean, spidery guitar and organ riffs \ninterweave with a hypnotic menace, providing a seductive backdrop \nfor Jim Morrison's captivating vocals and probing prose. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; was the \ncut that topped the charts and established the group as stars, but \nmost of the rest of the album is just as impressive, including some of their \nbest songs: the propulsive &quot;Break On Through&quot; (their first single), the \nbeguiling Oriental mystery of &quot;The Crystal Ship,&quot; the mysterious &quot;End of the \nNight,&quot; &quot;Take It as It Comes&quot; (one of several tunes besides &quot;Light My \nFire&quot; that also had hit potential), and the stomping rock of &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and \n&quot;Twentieth Century Fox.&quot; The 11-minute Oedipal drama &quot;The End&quot; was \nthe group at its most daring and, some would contend, overambitious. It was \nnonetheless a haunting cap to an album whose nonstop melodicism and \ndynamic tension would never be equaled by the group again, let alone bettered.\n\nOriginally released as part of the completed recorded works 2006 box set \nPerception, this deluxe edition of the Doors' classic 1967 debut is a \ndouble-disc set containing one CD featuring a newly remastered version of the \nalbum with bonus tracks and a DVD with a 5.1 Surround mix, bonus video \nfootage, and a photo gallery. Given that the Doors catalog was remastered just \nseven years before this box, the sonics of these 2006s remasters are \nnoticeable but not radically different -- with the exception of The Doors, for \nresearch revealed that the debut was mastered a half-speed slow and \nthis edition restores it to its correct speed. It's a subtle but significant \ndifference, as opposed to the rest of the remasters, which are subtle \nbut only significant to audiophiles who know this music intimately. Similarly, \nthe bonus tracks are not major revelations: two takes of &quot;Moonlight \nDrive&quot; plus a vocal version of &quot;Indian Summer,&quot; while the videos include &quot;Break \non Through&quot; and a Toronto television broadcast of &quot;The End&quot; from \n1967. Just because these aren't big revelations doesn't mean that this deluxe \nedition doesn't live up to its title: this is the best-sounding, \nbest-presented reissue of this album yet.\n\nThe songs &quot;Break on Through (To the Other Side)&quot; and &quot;The End&quot; were both \nreleased censored with the album. During &quot;Break on Through&quot; the part where \nJim Morrison sings &quot;She gets, she gets&quot; was originally recorded as &quot;She gets \nhigh.&quot; The interlude singing part near the end of &quot;The End&quot; was censored \nand taken out. It included Jim using the word fuck over and over. Subsequent \nreleases of the album have both of the original parts intact, although \n1980s compact disc reissues appear to keep the verses censored. The band \naccepted this censorship but would supposedly refuse later to reword &quot;Light \nmy Fire&quot; in the infamous Ed Sullivan Show (&quot;Girl we couldn't get much higher&quot;), \nalthough according to Ray Manzarek, while singing this song, Jim \nMorrison simply forgot to replace the word.\n\nThe album's dark tone and frontman Jim Morrison's sexual charisma and wild \nlifestyle influenced much of rock and roll to come.\n\nThe album is generally thought of as the band's best work, in addition to being \none of the greatest debut albums by any band. It's also considered to \nbe one of the quintessential albums of the counterculture movement/Social \nRevolution. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted The Doors the 93rd greatest \nalbum of all time; in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 60. In 2003, \nthe album was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \n500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBREAK ON THROUGH (TO THE OTHER SIDE)\n\nThis short track fittingly commences the Doors debut album and single with itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \ndirect agenda of pushing all envelopes and exploring all facets of \nexistence. A daunting task that the band -- under the lyrical and spiritual \nleadership of Jim Morrison -- were ready to take on. Musically, the Doors \nunique, undeniably fresh and somewhat punk perspective, fused the mind altering \nideas of psychedelia with the intricate musicianship of jazz as well \nas the vibe of the burgeoning youth underground -- somehow creating a sound that \ndefined an era of rock and roll.\n\nImmediately the lyrics indicate that something is different. For example, \nMorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdestroyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdivideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to invoke images of day \nand night, reveal a literacy that had rarely been incorporated into rock music. \nBreak On ThroughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is structured like a love song. However, MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nphraseology cleverly juxtaposes romantic lyrics such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI found an island in \nyour arms/A country in your eyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the almost sinister lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œarms \nthat chain/Eyes that lieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nMusically, the Latin-derived opening -- courtesy of drummer John Densmore -- \ndraws the listener in. It builds with Ray ManzareksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ throbbing bass \npedals and Robbie KriegerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understated lead guitar. Suddenly, the band turn a \ncorner and sonically explode behind MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frenetic lead vocals, \nshouting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBreak on through to the other sideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Instead of MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s punk sneer \nand growl flying in the face of their image as an acid-dropping \npsychedelic hippie band, it serves as a wake up call to all concerned parties \nthat the social rules -- both spoken and understood -- have radically \nchanged and are no longer what they may seem. This was in essence what the Doors \nwere all about. \n\nElektra Records censors objected to the use of the word &quot;high&quot; in the middle \nsection of the song (after &quot;everybody loves my baby&quot;) due to its drug \nconnotations. The original album version has the line &quot;she gets&quot; repeated before \na grunt at the end. Live versions and later releases of the song \nhave the uncensored version with &quot;high&quot; restored.\n\nTHE CRYSTAL SHIP\n\nIt is regarded as a goodbye love song to Jim Morrison's first love, Mary \nWerbelo. Like much of The Doors' work, it sets up an eerie, dark flow. It's \nrumored to have been the band's first long song, especially for Ray Manzarek's \nand Robby Krieger's improvisations, but was changed by When The \nMusic's Over.\n\nThe inspiration for the &quot;crystal ship&quot; is an oil rig off of Sand's beach in Isla \nVista, California.\n\nJohn Densmore &quot;co-writer&quot; states: &quot;Jim wrote The Crystal Ship for Mary Werbelo \nin 1964, a girlfriend with whom he was breaking up, it was in his \nfamous notebook of poetry he had when we formed. (sic),. . . . The song was a \ngoodbye love song.&quot;\n\nThe song was covered by Duran Duran for their 1995 covers album Thank You. It \nwas also covered by pianist George Winston on his album Night Divides \nthe Day - The Music of the Doors.\n\nThe song also appears on The X-files Movie Soundtrack by X.\n\nThe song has also appeared in television. An episode of Supernatural (TV series) \n-season two's Born Under a Bad Sign- uses the song in a particularly \ndark setting.\n\nJoe Perry covered the song on his 2005 eponymous debut album.\n\nDuring the '70's and early '80's, there was a popular Doors cover band from New \nJersey called &quot;The Crystal Ship.&quot; The band played mid-sized venues in \nthe tri-state area, like &quot;Mother's&quot; in Wayne, NJ, &quot;Great Gildersleeves&quot; in \nManhattan, &quot;My Father's Place&quot;, in Roslyn, Long Island, and &quot;Jimmy Burns'&quot; \nat the Jersey Shore. The band was formed in Hawthorne, NJ, and played its first \nfew gigs at a biker bar in Paterson called the Highland Tavern. The \nlead singer's name was Joe Vitagliano.\n\nIn the beginning of the song Bitchin' Camaro by the punk rock group the Dead \nMilkmen one character explains to the other that while at the Jersey \nShore, he plans on seeing his favorite Doors cover band Crystal Shit. This is \nlikely a reference to the Doors cover band, The Crystal Ship.\n\nIn the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a radio DJ (played by Guns N' \nRoses lead singer Axl Rose) states that he used to be in a band called \nCrystal Ship. This is most likely a reference to the New Jersey cover band as \nwell.\n\nJapanese psychedelic band Suishou no Fune's name translates to &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;\n\nNicole Atkins covered this song on her 2008 album Nicole Atkins Digs Other \nPeople's Songs.\n\nALABAMA SONG\n\nThe &quot;Alabama Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Whiskey Bar&quot;) was originally published in \nBertolt Brecht's Hauspostille (1927). It was set to music by Kurt Weill \nfor the 1927 &quot;Songspiel&quot; Mahagonny and used again in Weill's and Brecht's 1930 \nopera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. In the latter, it is \nperformed by the character Jenny and her fellow prostitutes in the first act. \nMusically it contains elements of foxtrot, blues and advanced soprano \ncoloraturas, sung by Jenny.\n\nThe song style is typical of German schlager music, which was popular in Europe \nduring the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe lyrics for the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; are in English (albeit specifically \nidiosyncratic English) and are performed in that language even when the opera \nis performed in its original German.\n\nJim Morrison, changed the second verse from:\n\nShow us the way to the next pretty boy to Show me the way to the next little \ngirl.\n\nThe first verse was:\n\nShow me the way to the next Whiskey bar,\n\nwhich David Bowie sang as:\n\nShow us the way to the next whiskey bar,\n\nIn the late 1970s (thereby matching how the line read in Brecht's Hauspostille \nbefore being part of the Mahagonny works). Bowie began performing his \ntake on &quot;Alabama Song&quot; on his 1978 tour and released a studio version the \nfollowing year. The Doors' version appeared on the first season of WKRP in \nCincinnati in the episode &quot;Fish Story&quot;.\n\n\nLIGHT MY FIRE\n\nfrom allmusicguide:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- from the quartetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-titled debut LP -- is the track that \npropelled the Doors onto the charts and into the collective \nconsciousness of rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll. The undeniably catchy melody and pulsating Bossa \nNova rhythms support MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obvious and blatantly sexual lyrics. \nAlthough the song is officially credited to the band, it was actually guitarist \nRobbie Krieger who came up with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon baby, light my fire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nhook. The performance however is a group effort in the classic sense, as they \nsymbiotically propel each other into some remarkably intense and \nemotionally charged interaction. This is not only true of the studio version, as \nthe presence of a live audience often intensified the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nresolve. Specifically, the instrumental trioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s improvisational skills are honed \nwhen coupled with their uncanny ability to instinctually support \nMorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mostly non-verbal and inaudible cues.\n\nBetween the verses, are some definitive psychedelic solos. Ray \nManzarekmelodically swirls his eerie and intricate leads through the spaces \nopened up \nin John DensmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fluid jazz and Eastern-influenced drumming. Krieger follows \nsuit with some incendiary fretwork that challenges and ultimately \nsteers his solo into a staccato phrase that instrumentally reunites the trio as \nthey reconvene for the final verse and chorus.\n\nThe Doors topped the charts with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it became both a fan \nfavourite and live staple. The track has a colourful performance history as \nwell -- highlighted by their first -- and likewise their last -- appearance on \nthe Ed Sullivan Show. Legend has it that after promising -- and \nsubsequently reneging -- to replace the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhigherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, during the live \ncoast-to-coast broadcast, the Doors were ex communicated from ever appearing \non the weekly variety show again. There are also numerous live recordings of the \ntrack on a variety of archival releases. Of particular note are the \n^Live at the Aquarius Theatre: The Second erformance (2000) and Live at the \nHollywood Bowl (1987) renderings.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has become synonymous with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s psychedelic and sexual \nrevolutions. It has been covered by a wide spectrum of talent, ranging \nfrom Calvert DeForrest [AKA Larry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Melman] to Jackie Wilson and Woody \nHerman. However, with the notable exception of Jose FelicianoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chart \ntopping version, none of the covers capture the raw interaction of the original. \n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nThe song originated as a Robby Krieger unfinished composition, which the other \nband members then expanded upon. There was also a radio edit that was \nshortened to just under five minutes with about half the instrumental portion in \nplace, released only to radio stations. Indeed, the band always \nstated that their preferred version was the original long version, while the \nshorter ones were solely produced at their company's request in order to \nbe able to receive radio airplay.\n\n&quot;Light My Fire&quot; was performed by The Doors on a famous appearance on The Ed \nSullivan Show September 17, 1967. In an oft-told legend, The Doors were \nasked to change the lyrics of the song (specifically, the line &quot;girl, we \ncouldn't get much higher&quot;). The producers told Morrison to write a new lyric \nfor the line, but he refused. The band promised to do so, but according to Jim \nMorrison he forgot to change the lyrics at the last minute and \nperformed the unedited version live on-air, which he attributed to having been \nnervous. Years later, Ray Manzarek wrote that even after being told to \nchange the lyrics, the band never even considered changing them. Despite \napplause from the crowd, Ed Sullivan was so upset that he refused to shake \nMorrison's hand as he left the stage. Backstage, the band was told that, despite \nbeing on the verge of signing a seven-episode deal to continue \nappearing on the program, they would never be on the Sullivan show again. \nReportedly, Morrison's cavalier response was: &quot;Hey, man, so what, we just \ndid the Sullivan show!&quot;\n\nJohn Densmore recalls that when Buick wanted to buy the piece for use in a 1968 \nTV commercial (&quot;Come on, Buick, light my fire&quot;) and Morrison, who had \nbeen out of town, learned that other group members agreed, Morrison called Buick \nand threatened to have a Buick smashed with a sledgehammer on a TV \nshow should the (presumably ready) commercial be aired.\n\nBACK DOOR MAN\n\nIn southern culture, the phrase &quot;back-door man&quot; refers to a man having an affair \nwith a married woman, using the back door as an exit before the \nhusband comes home. &quot;When everybody trying to sleep, I'm somewhere making my \nmidnight creep. / Every morning the rooster crow, something tell me I \ngot to go / I am a back door man&quot;, Wolf sings. The promiscuous &quot;back-door man&quot; \nis a standard theme found in many blues, including those by Charley \nPatton, Lightnin' Hopkins, Blind Willie McTell and Sara Martin; &quot;every sensible \nwoman got a back-door man,&quot; Martin wrote in &quot;Strange Loving Blues&quot; \n(1925). Robert Plant references the Dixon song in Led Zeppelin's &quot;Whole Lotta \nLove&quot; (1969): &quot;Shake for me girl, I want to be your back-door man.&quot; The \nphrase &quot;back-door man&quot; dates from the 1920s, but the term became a double \nentendre in the 1960s, also meaning &quot;one who practices anal intercourse.&quot;\n\nThe song became an early standard cover song of The Doors, along with Dixon's \nsongs &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; and &quot;Close to You&quot;.  The &quot;door&quot; of the song, \nlike the name of the band, suggests a Blakean symbol of perception, with an \nawareness of the 1960s Queer-culture double entendre giving the \nexpression an additional layer of meaning. The Doors' drummer John Densmore \ndescribed the song as &quot;deeply sexual and got everyone moving.&quot; The song \nalso appears on The Doors' live album Absolutely Live (1970).\n\nTHE END\n\nThere are few Doors songs that can lay claim to the same level of both musical \nand cultural significance as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Although the lengthy and \nconscious-shattering track rounds out the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eponymous debut, itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ concert \nlife actually pre-dates the long player. Legend has it that early \nperformances -- particularly during the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOedipus sectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- were not only \ngreeted with stunned silence, but ended up costing the band one of their \nfirst live gigs.\n\nLead vocalist and lyricist Jim MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poetic brilliance rarely, if ever, \nsurpassed this slow, languid and scarily psychedelic tale that \nsimultaneously draws on aspects of both love and hate. The narrative proved to \nbe far more complex than most concurrent pop/rock at the time. As \nsuch, it requires the listener to ultimately surrender to the complexity of the \nmultiple layers woven into the story line. In keeping with MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nlyrical capacity for ambiguity, an analysis often begs more questions than it \nultimately answers.\n\nThe tale of incestuous lust and murder comes full-circle and is framed by the \nultimate finality in MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s statement that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the end.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAlthough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was often included as part of the Doors early live sets, it \nbecame a real rarity in the wake of the litigious situations that \nMorrison found himself mired in during 1969. One of the last concert \nperformances is available on the posthumously issued live Doors In Detroit \n(2000) CD set.\n\nArguably the most notable cover version is by Nico, as the title track from her \n1974 release. Although it might seem impossible, she turns the song \ninto an even more torrid and wrenching musical maze of madness. Her version is \noften dismissed by Doors fans as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unlistenableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, however her rendering \non the seminal June 1, 1974 LP is perhaps more what Morrison actually intended.\n\nAnother notable use of this song was by Francis Ford Coppola during the \ncommencing sequence of his Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). The marriage \nof sound and image has rarely been as cinematically memorable. To quote Marlon \nBrando -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe horror ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the horrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nRobby Krieger's slinky, haunting guitar lines over D drone in DADGAD tuning \nusing a harmonic minor scale recall Indian drone and raga-based music, as \nhas often been noted, and the rolling and dramatic crescendoes of John \nDensmore's drums recall Indian tabla rhythms. The music as a whole, though, \ndoes not sound entirely or even particularly &quot;Indian&quot;. The sharp, ringing edge \nof the guitar recalls the 50s rock and roll style, while the \nfingerpicking attack may derive equally from the flamenco guitar style Krieger \nhad studied as a youth and from folk music. Ray Manzarek's organ is \nused sparingly to provide an inconspicuous bass line (I-V-I-V-I-V...) and fills. \nOne may find a strong similarity to Chopin's &quot;Funeral March&quot; theme \nand also to Sandy Bull's guitar instrumental &quot;Blend&quot; - but this may be more to \ndo with the quality of the melodic minor scale than with any specific \ninfluence.\n\nStructurally, the song rises to three separate mini-crescendoes separated by \nslower sections of half-spoken, half-sung lyrics before building to an \nenormous psychedelic crescendo right after Jim Morrison sings the &quot;meet me at \nthe back of the blue bus&quot; verse. Previously, the song had been weaving \nalong on its melodies to an encounter with the ruling powers of the mind, the \ncontrolling &quot;father&quot; structure and the longed-for &quot;mother&quot;, or freedom. \nThe final crescendo represents either an attempt to break through to that \nfreedom, or more likely, an Oedipal sexual climax. The sexual \nrepresentation seems more likely given the similar crescendo apex very much \nalong the lines of Ravel's 'Bolero&quot;. Afterward, &quot;The End&quot; departs on a \nwistful note when Morrison sings, &quot;It hurts to set you free, but you'll never \nfollow me. The end of laughter and soft lies, the end of nights we \ntried to die.&quot; In the context of Morrison's first interpretation quoted above, \nthis lyric and the associated music that softly reiterates themes from \nthe opening may mean that the comfort of childhood will be sacrificed for \nfreedom.[\n\nShortly past the mid-point of the nearly 12-minute long album version, the song \nsuddenly enters a spoken-word section with the words, &quot;The killer \nawoke before dawn... &quot; That section of the song reaches a dramatic climax with \nthe lines, &quot;Father/ Yes son?/ I want to kill you/ Mother, I want to... \n(fuck you),&quot; (with the last two words screamed out unintelligibly). This is \noften considered a reference to Sophocles' Oedipus the King, a production \nof which Jim Morrison had worked on while at Florida State University.\n\nSaid Morrison in 1969, &quot;Everytime I hear that song, it means something else to \nme. It started out as a simple good-bye song probably just to a girl, \nbut I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don't know. \nI think it's sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that \nit could be almost anything you want it to be.&quot; Producer Paul Rothchild said in \nan interview that he believed the song to be an inside trip, and that \n&quot;kill the father&quot; means destroying everything hierarchical, controlling, and \nrestrictive in one's psyche, while &quot;fuck the mother&quot; means embracing \neverything that is expansive, flowing, and alive in the psyche. Ray Manzarek, \nthe former keyboard player for the Doors spoke about it defensively \nsaying,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tHe was giving voice in a rock 'n' roll setting to the Oedipus complex, \nat the time a widely discussed tendency in Freudian psychology. He \nwasn't saying he wanted to do that to his own mom and dad. He was re-enacting a \nbit of Greek drama. It was theatre! \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMorrison may have been influenced by the Jungian concepts of individuation and \narchetypes, and was certainly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche's \nconcept of going beyond the limited types of human beings that hitherto existed \nby loving Dionysian vitality and life (&quot;the mother&quot;) while rejecting \nApollonian systems and traditions (&quot;the father&quot;).\n\nThe lyrical reference to &quot;the Blue Bus&quot; has been variously conjectured to refer \nto either Indian mystic Meher Baba's &quot;Blue Bus&quot; tours of the 1930s or \nto Santa Monica's &quot;Big Blue Bus&quot; public bus lines. The link to Meher Baba seems \nunlikely given the dark and nihilistic tone of the song, with its \nreferences to insanity, patricide and incest, concepts alien to the life and \noutlook of Meher Baba. A reference to a bus line is a somewhat better \npossibility, but probably the most likely conjecture is that Morrison was \nreferring to the drug numorphan (oxymorphone), an opioid substitute for \nmorphine, which in the drug culture at the time was often referred to as &quot;The \nBlue Bus&quot; (it was available in blue 10mg instant-release tabs). Because \nof its highly euphoric effect Numorphan was very popular with the drug using \ncommunity before it was withdrawn from the market in the 1970's. Given \nMorrison's well-known affinity for drug and alcohol use, and the overall \n&quot;otherworldly&quot; tenor of the song, this seems a more likely probability. The \ninspiring image would be that of being together with one's lover in the altered, \ndreamy state of consciousness induced after taking the powerful \nopiate-like drug. Similarly, the line &quot;the blue bus is calling us&quot; likely refers \nto the addictive attraction of oxymorphone that develops in abusers \nof the drug, and &quot;driver where you takin' us&quot; would refer, again, to the dreamy, \nexploratory, unpredictable state of altered consciousness \nexperienced while under the influence of the drug.\n\nAnother explanation for &quot;the Blue Bus&quot; phrase would be as a reference to the \nblue buses that, in the United States, military inductees boarded for \ntransport to basic training during the era of the Vietnam War, when the song was \nwritten. Morrison may have intended it to be an anti-Vietnam anthem. \nMorrison's father was an admiral in the U.S. Navy and as a &quot;navy brat&quot;, he was \nfamiliar with military life; no doubt he saw many &quot;blue buses&quot; in his \nyouth.a[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âº]\n\nThe following are phrases from &quot;The End&quot; that may help put the phrase &quot;the Blue \nBus&quot; in context. The phrase &quot;The west is the best, The west is the \nbest, Get here, and we'll do the rest&quot; could summon images of troops preparing \nfor transport to Vietnam to fight in the proxy &quot;West vs. Communist&quot; \ncold war. Other phrases that could be seen as military allusions include &quot;Lost \nin a Roman...wilderness of pain&quot; and &quot;The killer awoke before dawn, he \nput his boots on; He took a face from the ancient gallery.&quot; This may be the \nimage of a soldier dressing to do battle in modern times, with an \nallusion toward a Roman infantryman. The phrase could also be an image of a \nGreek actor putting on a mask to perform in a play, except prior language \nimplies a Roman allusion rather than one of an ancient Greek. Much of the brutal \ncontext of the song, implying random acts of killing, may make more \nsense in the context of war rather than in a drug trip gone bad, or the \ncarefully prescribed plot of a Greek tragedy (cf. Oedipus). Further, the song \nbegins and ends similarly: &quot;This is the end, Beautiful friend; This is the end, \nMy only friend; The end of our elaborate plans; the end of everything \nthat stands; The end; No safety or surprise; The end; I'll never look into your \neyes... again.&quot;\n\n&quot;The End&quot; was most famously used as a framing device for Francis Ford Coppola's \n1979 film Apocalypse Now, in which its dark, poetic passage marked \nthe film's descent into the surreal. The sound of helicopter rotors from the \nbeginning of the film are often included in recordings of the song. \nHowever, this version of the song is also incomplete, and the sounds of a jungle \nreplace most of the lyrics in the second half of the song.\n\nThis usage has led to other, often satirical usages for the song's appearance:\n\n    * Three sequences on The Simpsons television series in which the song plays \nwhile Homer contemplates suicide and another, &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang \nBangalore&quot;, in which, in an Apocalypse Now parody, he thinks he is a god, Smoke \non the Daughter, When Bart raises his head out of the pile of leg \nwarmers in the smoke outside, the song's instrumental portion is heard, \nmirroring a sequence in the film Apocalypse Now.\n    * A Saturday Night Live sketch in which John McCain is driven to madness \nwhile campaigning for George W. Bush as a parody of Apocalypse Now.\n    * It was used in the final episode of The Dennis Miller Show, during another \nApocalypse Now parody sequence, in which Dennis was airlifted by (we \nare led to believe) a helicopter out of the set.\n    * The song was also referenced in a 2006 episode of The Venture Bros. \nentitled &quot;Assassinanny 911&quot;, in a scene which also parodied the Apocalypse \nNow usage, when Hank (under the influence of poison) quotes the Oedipal section \nof the song and tries to kill his father with a paper machete sword \nwhile a Doors-influenced score plays in the background.\n    * The song was parodied in an episode of Animaniacs, the plot of which was \npartly a parody of Apocalypse Now. At the start of the episode, a \nvoice actor sings in a Morrison-like voice, &quot;This is the beginning... the \nbeginning of our story...the beginning...&quot;. At the middle of the story, the \nword &quot;beginning&quot; is replaced with the word &quot;middle&quot;. At the end of the episode \nhe says &quot;This is the ending...the ending of our story...the \nending...the ending...the ending...the ending.&quot; and a Jim Morrison character is \nseen being run over by a golf cart.\n    * Director Martin Scorsese once used the song in a sex scene montage in his \nearly student film Who's That Knocking at My Door (1968).\n    * The song was also used in Oliver Stone's 1991 film The Doors, where it \nplays while the band explored drugs in the desert.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInfo taken from allmusicguide and wikipedia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da55aac63178232415d3ed21715d35a2515b8e5","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+The+Doors+%5BRePoPo%5D+%28Perception+Remaster%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da55aac63178232415d3ed21715d35a2515b8e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,165,90,172,99,23,130,50,65,93,62,210,23,21,211,90,37,21,184,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
