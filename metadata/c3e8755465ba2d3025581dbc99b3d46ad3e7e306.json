Kirkland, who was born in Jamaica, raised in Alabama from the time he was two till he went off with the Sugar Girls Medicine show at twelve. His teens brought him to Indiana, eventually settling in Detroit. There he polished his Blues to recording status. He toured and recorded with John Lee Hooker for seven and a half years. They made a solid team before parting in the 60's.\n\nKirkland moved to Georgia, where he was bandleader for Otis Redding. Continuous road tours had him working with Ruth Brown, Little Richard, Ben King, Little Johnnie Taylor and many more greats. In 1962, Kirkland recorded &quot;It's the Blues Man&quot; for Prestige, reissued by Fantasy as a Blues collector's item. Kirkland's hit the &quot;Hawg&quot; recorded by Stax/Volt label earned him national celebrity. The &quot;Hawg&quot; is now available on Atlantic records.\n\nIn the early 70's employment for Blues men was hard to come by, but faithful individuals such as Peter Lowry sought out Kirkland and is credited for bringing him back into the circuit. With Lowry and his Trix label, Kirkland recorded &quot;Front and Center&quot; and &quot;The Devil and Other Blues Demons&quot;, now available from 32 Blues.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e8755465ba2d3025581dbc99b3d46ad3e7e306","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Eddie+Kirkland+-+Front+And+Center","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e8755465ba2d3025581dbc99b3d46ad3e7e306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,232,117,84,101,186,45,48,37,88,29,188,153,179,212,106,211,231,227,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
