It combines regional surveys with major articles on noteworthy new ships and other important developments. Besides the latest warship projects, it also looks at wider issues of importance to navies, such as aviation and electronics, and calls on expertise from around the globe.\n\nThe 2014 edition will look in detail at the Royal New Zealand Navy and at the Royal Navy three years after the SDSR (Strategic Defence and Security Review), while significant ships will include the Danish Iver Huitfeldt class frigate, the German 212A class submarine and the US JHSV Spearhead. There are technological reviews dealing with naval aviation and current and recent torpedo developments. Intended to make interesting reading as well asproviding authoritative reference, there is a strong visual emphasis, including specially commissioned drawings and the most recently released photographs and artists' impressions. For anyone with an interest in contemporary naval affairs, whether an enthusiast or a defense professional, this annual has become required reading.\n\nBook Cover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://img.bi/#/tMAvp77!xy7mnQWrSZUQ1iO9mgdJ3RRwWqAhKAD-63NwrHXj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://img.bi/#/tMAvp77!xy7mnQWrSZUQ1iO9mgdJ3RRwWqAhKAD-63NwrHXj&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c69831b7f2e4e50769f527e6e42db22a95b05da","amp;dn":"Seaforth+World+Naval+Review%2C+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c69831b7f2e4e50769f527e6e42db22a95b05da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,131,27,127,46,78,80,118,159,82,126,110,66,219,34,169,91,5,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
