Commanding his own squadron of trusted veterans, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful pilots, thanks to his superior strategic thinking, his courage, and his survivalist instinct that always seems able to get him back home if he has to ditch his aircraft. EnnisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on the character sees him teaming up with an American squadron, camped behind enemy lines in the heart of the Sahara desert. Although the two squadrons take a bit of time to get over their cultural differences, BrittonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership pulls the group together to take on some serious German opposition.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76615e6ccb673a9b549f29bf407f58573e6aaa1","amp;dn":"Garth+Ennis%27+Battler+Britton+%28Complete%29+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76615e6ccb673a9b549f29bf407f58573e6aaa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,102,21,230,204,182,115,169,181,73,242,155,244,7,245,133,115,230,170,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
