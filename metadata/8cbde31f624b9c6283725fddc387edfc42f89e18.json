Cop comes back to his old 'hood but this time its in Kingston, Jamaica. That means dancehall, reggae and a great performance by Paul Campbell who was also in Dancehall Queen. Very entertaining and worth watching because of Campbell's acting. He moves the film along and is a presence on the screen. The &quot;Dancehall Queen&quot; Audrey Reid plays the love interest. The acting is good all the way around. The scenes were shot in the area of Dungle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cbde31f624b9c6283725fddc387edfc42f89e18","amp;dn":"Third+World+Cop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cbde31f624b9c6283725fddc387edfc42f89e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,189,227,31,98,75,156,98,131,114,95,221,195,135,237,252,66,248,158,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
