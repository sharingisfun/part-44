While most new bands and interpreters center their work on futile material and focus on easy formulas and clichÃƒÂ©s, she is concerned in really adding something to the superb tradition of MPB, which is quite a challenging task. This is her third album, where, with special guests Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, Gilberto Gil, Paulinho da Viola, Velha Guarda da Portela, Ãƒâ€°poca de Ouro, NanÃƒÂ¡ Vasconcelos, Carlinhos Brown, and others, she delivers some of her hits: &quot;Maria de Verdade,&quot; &quot;Na Estrada,&quot; &quot;Segue o Seco,&quot; &quot;DanÃƒÂ§a da Solidao,&quot; &quot;De Mais NinguÃƒÂ©m,&quot; &quot;Bem Leve,&quot; and &quot;BalanÃƒÂ§a Pema.&quot; One of the best pop albums from the '90s, she makes clear that she is after a new language in which the respect for the rich musical tradition of Brazil is evident. ~ Alvaro Neder Recorded at Nas Nuvens, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil and Skyline, New York between March and May, 1994.
