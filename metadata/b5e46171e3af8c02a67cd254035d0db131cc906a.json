ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story of bugs, worms, rot, and failure; of learning, replanting, harvesting, and eating. The road is long and riddled with mistakes, but by the end of her yearlong experiment, Warren s sons and husband have become her biggest fans-in fact, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re even eager to help harvest (and eat) the beautiful bounty she brings in.\n\nFull of tips and recipes to help anyone interested in growing and preparing at least a small part of their diet at home, The Quarter-Acre Farm is a warm, witty tale about family, food, and the incredible gratification that accompanies self-sufficiency.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e46171e3af8c02a67cd254035d0db131cc906a","amp;dn":"The+Quarter-Acre+Farm%3A+How+I+Kept+the+Patio%2C+Lost+the+Lawn%2C+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e46171e3af8c02a67cd254035d0db131cc906a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,228,97,113,227,175,140,2,166,124,210,84,3,93,13,177,49,204,144,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
