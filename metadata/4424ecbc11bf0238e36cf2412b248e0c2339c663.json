B. Dick and his crew of gay crusaders from the planet Anus, a member in good standing of the Federation of Gay Planets, happen upon a remote and primitive world called Earth, whose surface is inexplicably covered with dangerous &quot;female creatures.&quot; Anything at all could be going on down there, perhaps even the dreaded &quot;kissing&quot; our heroes have read about! For the sake of Earth's men, the Gayniggers decide to dispose of the female creatures and show the planet the error of its ways.\n\nThis isn't a comedy as you would usually expect to find one; you can't sit down alone and expect to be entertained much by it. This is the sort of thing that you need to get a few friends together for (preferably numbering no female creatures among them), so you can all sit around and laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all: at the pocket-change sets and special effects, at the ship computer's Speak&amp;Spell voice, at the impossible characters, and of course, simply at the fact that someone actually created a film called &quot;Gayniggers From Outer Space.&quot;\n\nInterleave (in ms):                             42          \nPreload (in ms):                                522      \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Split        \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1      \n                                                                               \n--- Video Information ---                                                      \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD 1.0.0          \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            27:38.852                \nFrame Count:                                    39773            \nFrame Width (pixels):                           448                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          240                  \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.867                    \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                    \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.867                      \nFrames Per Second:                              23.976          \nPics Per Second:                                23.976            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           525                \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                  \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP            \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.204&quot;                    \n                                                                                     \n                                                                               \n--- Audio Information ---                                                      \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                            \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                  \nAudio Codec Status (e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): Codec(s) are Installed            \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         44100            \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            112                \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            CBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      1          \nPreload (in ms):                                504      \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Aligned        \nTotal System Bitrate (kbps):                    0            \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4424ecbc11bf0238e36cf2412b248e0c2339c663","amp;dn":"Gayniggers.From.Outer.Space.Digitally.Remastered.XviD-NoGrp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4424ecbc11bf0238e36cf2412b248e0c2339c663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,36,236,188,17,191,2,56,227,108,242,65,43,36,142,12,35,57,198,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
