For example Classical Music, Jazz, Kids Music, Home videos, TV, etc. can each configured with custom views and playback rules. For example, a Classical Music collection can be configured to display a Conductor node and an Original Year column, and play with cross-fading disabled, whereas Contemporary Music wouldn't.\nMediaMonkey gives you all the tools you need to manage large music / movie collections.\n\nOrganize Files Automatically:\n------------------------------\nAutomatically organize and rename audio / video files on your hard drive into a logical hierarchy of your choice according to a set of rules that you define. Classical music can be organized by Composer and Home Videos by Date and MediaMonkey will take care of organizing them automatically as a background process.\n\nAdvanced AutoPlaylists:\n------------------------\nCreate advanced AutoPlaylists which automatically generate a music mix to suit your mood. Just define practically any set of criteria and the mix is automatically created.\nSynchronize Advanced Playlist with Portable Devices, giving you the perfect tool for rapidly downloading a subset of your collection to your device. For example, you can choose to sync a random subset totalling 256 MB of music that match a defined set of criteria.\nFor the average user, creating a music mix and synching it couldn't be easier.\n\nProfessional-quality CD Ripping:\n---------------------------------\nSecure Ripping detects when a CD has been damaged and throttles the disc's rotation until it is sufficiently slow to deliver identical reads on at least 2 occasions. Once a disc has been ripped, MediaMonkey can validate that it was bit-perfect by comparing the resultant data to that of the AccurateRip database.\nMediaMonkey delivers professional quality ripping in consumer-friendly software.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693f08c8198d016fbe0860e0974fa24dd71a441c","amp;dn":"MediaMonkey+Gold+v4.0.5.1496+%2B+Serials+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693f08c8198d016fbe0860e0974fa24dd71a441c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,63,8,200,25,141,1,111,190,8,96,224,151,79,162,77,215,26,68,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
