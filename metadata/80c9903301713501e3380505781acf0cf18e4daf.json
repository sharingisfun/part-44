The Night Time Is the Right Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09 \n\nPlaying Time.........: 29.11\nTotal Size...........: 160,03 MB\n\nThe opening track is the title track, 'Green River', a delicious blast of prime American rock'n'roll, and easily one of Creedence's very very best songs. An instant classic, that opens an instantly classic album.\n\n'Commotion' is a somewhat darker track, that oozes of the Southern states of the US, of swamps &amp; bleak air. It is majestic in the very anti-majesty of the melody.\n\n'Tombstone Shadow' follows in this vein, also setting a very gloomy (but not at all nocturnal) mood for the record.\n\n'Wrote A Song For Everyone' is lighter (but still pretty dusky by Creedence standards), &amp; simply just drop-dead gorgeous. An underrated classic, that is followed by arguably the very best track on the album, the near-apocalypse of 'Bad Moon Rising'. Like the title track, this song simply represents EVERYTHING that Creedence is about, it is catchy, light, disturbing, and simply the essence of the word 'rock'n'roll'!\n\nThe next song is 'Lodi', another overlooked gem. With it, the mood of the melodies darken again, in a despairing tale built by great lyrics &amp; wonderful playing.\n\n'Cross-Tie Walker' is another great song, where the mood is simply 'hopelessness' and 'emptiness', more of a dusky, hollow midday, than the kind of 'nightlife', that bands like Velvet Underground and the excellent Doors employed to make their soundscapes darker.\n\n'Sinister Purpose' is darker than the other tracks on the record, less empty &amp; more black, and with the weight of guitars seemingly heavier than on any other track on the record.\n\nThen, with the only cover on the album, 'The Night Time Is The Right Time', Creedence ends the album in one of the most excellent endings they ever made. Like most other Creedence covers, 'The Night Time Is The Right Time' is made so immaculately Creedence, that only the liner notes tell you, that this is not a Fogerty original.\n\n'Green River' is probably the darkest album Creedence ever made. The bouncy rock of the title track and the classic 'Bad Moon Rising' are made on the usual Creedence-formula of catchy jubilant rock music set to pessimist lyrics of impending apocalypse and pollution. But on the rest of the album, even the music sounds pessimistic, or, more precisely, as already said, 'hopeless' and 'empty' (the mood is empty, the music is brilliant, it just describes emptiness, its not empty like in 'bad quality', not at all). 'Green River' is not really the Creedence album to cheer you up, but rather one of their deepest testaments to the haunting despair of the everyday life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c9903301713501e3380505781acf0cf18e4daf","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+-+Green+River+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c9903301713501e3380505781acf0cf18e4daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,201,144,51,1,113,53,1,227,56,5,5,120,26,207,12,241,142,77,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
