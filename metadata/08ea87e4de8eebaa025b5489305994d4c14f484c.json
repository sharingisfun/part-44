This gory compendium details the frankly ridiculous ways in which a number of ill-fated unfortunates met (or failed to meet) their maker at the hands of lamentably inept executioners. With black and white illustrations, this book brings together a mixture of bungled executions, strange last requests and classic one-liners from medieval times to the present day. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08ea87e4de8eebaa025b5489305994d4c14f484c","amp;dn":"Amazing+True+Stories+of+Execution+Blunders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08ea87e4de8eebaa025b5489305994d4c14f484c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,234,135,228,222,142,235,170,2,91,84,137,48,89,148,212,193,79,72,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
