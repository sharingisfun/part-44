Under \r\npolitical pressure to close the Moonbase following the deaths, the Director-\r\nGeneral of the European space programme appoints David Caulder to take over \r\nas Director of Moonbase 3 and investigate the accident.\r\n\r\nMoonbase 3 Behemoth.\r\nWhen two seismologists mysteriously vanish in the Mare Frigoris region, Caulder \r\nbans all travel into the area, a decision that upsets Dr Heinz Laubenthal \r\n(Peter Miles) who is conducting research in the area but won't reveal what he \r\nis working on. Some time later, Laubenthal is killed in an explosion in his \r\nlaboratory. Investigations reveal that the lab walls were breached from the \r\noutside and strange tracks are found leading from the lab in the direction of \r\nthe Mare Frigoris. As rumours of space monsters begin to disrupt life on the \r\nmoonbases, Caulder leads a team into Mare Frigoris in search of the truth.\r\n\r\nMoonbase 3 Achilles Heel.\r\nWhile Caulder is pressured to deliver results from Moonbase 3's research \r\nprogramme under threat of budget cuts, the CORA radio astronomy project is \r\nthrown into disarray by a series of accidents. As the situation develops it \r\nbecomes apparent that one of the three CORA scientists - Adam Blaney (Edward \r\nBrayshaw), Bill Knight (Malcolm Reynolds) and Kate Weyman (Anne Ridler) - is \r\nsuffering from a mental breakdown and is sabotaging the project.\r\n\r\nMoonbase 3 Outsiders.\r\nFaced with an inspection ahead of potential budget cuts, Caulder's hopes of \r\ndemonstrating that the Moonbase 3 research programme is worthwhile lie with \r\ntwo brilliant, but erratic, researchers, Stephen Partness (Tom Kempinkski) \r\nand Peter Conway (John Hallam), both of whom are showing evidence of cracking \r\nunder the strain.\r\n\r\nMoonbase 3 Castor and Pollux.\r\nWhile Caulder explores the possibility of participating in a joint expedition \r\nto Jupiter with the Russians, an accident during a routine docking manoeuvre \r\nwith a satellite leaves a shuttle with Tom Hill on board tumbling out into \r\ndeep space. Caulder mounts a rescue mission but must convince the Russians \r\nto help him.\r\n\r\nMoonbase 3 View of a Dead Planet.\r\nControversy surrounds the Arctic Sun Project, a plan to detonate a hydrogen \r\nbomb above the Arctic Circle to melt the icecaps and open up new land for \r\ndevelopment. When the project is initiated, all contact with Earth is lost \r\nas it becomes enveloped in a strange mist. The inhabitants of the Moon \r\ncolonies struggle to come to terms with the possibility that Earth has been \r\ndestroyed and they are all that's left of humanity.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Donald Houston.\r\n=&gt;-Fiona Gaunt.\r\n=&gt;-Ralph Bates.\r\n\r\nDirectors.\r\n=&gt;-Ken Hannam.\r\n=&gt;-Christopher Barry.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Sci-Fi : Cult Classic : Drama.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1973.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 451MiB : 447MiB : 453MiB : 455MiB : 449MiB : 454MiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 217 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Runtimes...................: 51mn50s : 51mn19s : 51mn58s : 52mn15s : 51mn34s : 52mn11s.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 4:3.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 544.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 101 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 161 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c3f4e7c2c6b7a807d229d1b3d7e4c2a952d021","amp;dn":"Moonbase+3+-+6+Part+Mini+Series+Sci-Fi+1973+Eng+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c3f4e7c2c6b7a807d229d1b3d7e4c2a952d021","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,195,244,231,194,198,183,168,7,210,41,209,179,215,228,194,169,82,208,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
