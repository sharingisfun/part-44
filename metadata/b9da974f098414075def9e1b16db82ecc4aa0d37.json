Most of the record consists of challenging songs like Coltrane's &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot; and Grachan Moncur III's &quot;Sonny's Back,&quot; which gives Patton -- as well as his supporting band, featuring guitarist Ed Cherry and tenor saxophonist Dave Hubbard -- the chance to create intricate yet accessible music. This is music that can be heard as simply a good groove yet it rewards careful listening. This One's for J.A. again confirms that Patton has made one of the rare comebacks in jazz, one that does justice to his earlier work.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9da974f098414075def9e1b16db82ecc4aa0d37","amp;dn":"John+Patton+Quintet+-+This+One%27s+For+JA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9da974f098414075def9e1b16db82ecc4aa0d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,218,151,79,9,132,20,7,93,239,158,27,22,219,130,236,196,170,13,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
