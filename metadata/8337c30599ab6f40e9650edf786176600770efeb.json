Few classics have had a more fraught history, starting with the dicey notion of combining the radically different approaches of documentarist Robert Flaherty and supernaturalist F.W. Murnau. After selecting the South Seas locations, collaborating on the story, and doing some preliminary photography, Flaherty withdrew, leaving Murnau to realize this tale of forbidden love and implacable retribution in an earthly paradise. The results, ravishing to behold, complete a spiritual trilogy begun with Nosferatu (1921-22) and Sunrise (1927), Murnau's other films of young couples drawn asunder by phantoms. Floyd Crosby won an Academy AwardÃ‚Â® for his cinematography.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8337c30599ab6f40e9650edf786176600770efeb","amp;dn":"Tabu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8337c30599ab6f40e9650edf786176600770efeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,55,195,5,153,171,111,64,233,101,14,223,120,97,118,96,7,112,239,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
