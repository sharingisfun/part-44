His quest is for heritage beef and is shocked    \n    to discover that five breeds are on the critically       \n    endangered list. He heads to Scotland to meet a beef      \n    farmer dedicated to reviving the fortunes of the           \n    original, traditional Aberdeen Angus. Amongst the         \n    dishes he cooks in the Revival kitchen is a stupendous   \n    slow roast four bone rib of beef complete with            \n    Yorkshire puddings. If anything will persuade you to       \n    try rare breed beef it will be this incredible Sunday     \n    roast.                                                   \n                                                              \n    Seafood supporter Valentine Warner wants to reverse the    \n    fortunes of British cockles and mussels. He discovers     \n    that the vast majority of our mussels are exported, and  \n    our cockle industry has shrunk to almost nothing. He is   \n    determined to remind us that these nutritious and          \n    plentiful fruits of the sea are fresh and available       \n    right on our doorstep. To encourage us to start buying   \n    them Valentine rustles up some delicious dishes in the    \n    Revival kitchen to show us how easy our shellfish is to    \n    cook.                                                     \n                                                               \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016zcvs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016zcvs&lt;/a&gt;            \n                                                              \n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&lt;/a&gt;      \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2424f4f8e12fc67a03b9448e36f101d5cb38ec91","amp;dn":"Great.British.Food.Revival.S02E03.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2424f4f8e12fc67a03b9448e36f101d5cb38ec91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,36,244,248,225,47,198,122,3,185,68,142,54,241,1,213,203,56,236,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
