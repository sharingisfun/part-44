Of course we keep pushing those limits back with clever new technologies; yet living systems are undeniably in decline.\n\nThese trends need not be in conflictÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, there are fortunes to be made in reconciling them.\n\nNatural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins, is the first book to explore the lucrative opportunities for businesses in an era of approaching environmental limits.\n\nIn this groundbreaking blueprint for a new economy, three leading business visionaries explain how the world is on the verge of a new industrial revolutionÃ¢â‚¬â€one that promises to transform our fundamental notions about commerce and its role in shaping our future. Natural Capitalism describes a future in which business and environmental interests increasingly overlap, and in which businesses can better satisfy their customers' needs, increase profits, and help solve environmental problems all at the same time.\n\nhttp://www.natcap.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89c119c9b430fed8f4bf0f5059eadaea4bbc047","amp;dn":"%28eBook%29+-+Natural+Capitalism+-+Amory+Lovins+Hunter+Lovins+and+Pa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89c119c9b430fed8f4bf0f5059eadaea4bbc047","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,156,17,156,155,67,15,237,143,75,240,245,5,158,173,174,164,187,192,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
