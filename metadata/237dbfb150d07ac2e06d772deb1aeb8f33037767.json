Ever since thenÃ¢â‚¬â€ even as she built a thriving career as a food and travel writer in New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â€Salma has had a hunch that Beirut was still her home. She kept dreaming of moving backÃ¢â‚¬â€and finally decided to do it.\n\nBut could she resume her life in Beirut, so many years after her family moved away? Could she, or anyone for that matter, ever really go home again? \n\nJasmine and Fire is SalmaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poignant and humorous journey of try-ing to resettle in Beirut and fumbling through the new realities of life in one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most complex, legendary, ever-vibrant, ever- troubled cities. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, in a year of roiling changes around the Middle East and the rise of the Arab Spring, Salma found herself in the midst of the turmoil, experiencing it all up close. \n\nAs she comes to grips with all the changes in her lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€a love left behind in New York and new relationships blossoming in BeirutÃ¢â‚¬â€Salma takes comfort in some of LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enduring traditions, particularly its extraordinary food culture. Through the sights, sounds, and flavors of a city full of beauty, tragedy, despair, and hope, Salma slowly begins to reconnect with the place sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longed for her entire life.\nSharing Widget","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237dbfb150d07ac2e06d772deb1aeb8f33037767","amp;dn":"Salma+Abdelnour+-+Jasmine+and+Fire%3A+A+Bittersweet+Year+in+Beirut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237dbfb150d07ac2e06d772deb1aeb8f33037767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,125,191,177,80,208,122,194,224,109,119,45,235,26,235,143,51,3,119,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
