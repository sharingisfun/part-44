Using a synthesis of memoir, reportage, and cultural critique, Almond asks a series of provocative questions:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Does our addiction to football foster a tolerance for violence, greed, racism, and homophobia?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What does it mean that our society has transmuted the intuitive physical joys of childhood - run, leap, throw, tackle - into a billion-dollar industry?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How did a sport that causes brain damage become such an important emblem for our institutions of higher learning?\n\nThere has never been a book that exposes the dark underside of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite game with such searing candor.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4e754197a946d7e41372b90723beda484543b81","amp;dn":"Against+Football+One+Fan%27s+Reluctant+Manifesto+%28Steve+Almond%29+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4e754197a946d7e41372b90723beda484543b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,231,84,25,122,148,109,126,65,55,43,144,114,59,237,164,132,84,59,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
