A Companion to Roman Architecture presents a selective overview of the critical issues and approaches that have transformed scholarly understanding of this rich field of study in recent decades. This volume draws on new archaeological discoveries and theoretical approaches in order to provide an updated historical understanding of Roman architecture.\n\nWritten by leading experts in architectural history who aim to understand Roman architecture as an integrated cultural practice, the Companion covers formal analysis, the design and construction process, the ancient and modern reception of Roman architecture and the dynamic interplay among aesthetics, social structure, politics, and geography in the production and use of Roman architecture. With cross-disciplinary sections covering technology, history, art, politics, and archaeology, this collection is an essential reference work for students and scholars.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Editors\nRoger B.
