Revised and updated by Dr. David Dowling, Fluid Mechanics, 5e is suitable for both a first or second course in fluid mechanics at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level. The leading advanced general text on fluid mechanics, it includes a free copy of the DVD &quot;Multimedia Fluid Mechanics,&quot; 2e. With the inclusion of the DVD, students can gain additional insight about fluid flows through nearly 1,000 fluids video clips, can conduct flow simulations in any of more than 20 virtual labs and simulations, and can view dozens of other new interactive demonstrations and animations, thereby enhancing their fluid mechanics learning experience.\n\nAlong with more than 100 new figures, the text has been reorganized and consolidated to provide a better flow and more cohesion of topics.\nChanges made to the book's pedagogy in the first several chapters accommodate the needs of students who have completed minimal prior study of fluid mechanics.\nMore than 200 new or revised end-of-chapter problems illustrate fluid mechanical principles and draw on phenomena that can be observed in everyday life \n \n  \n920 pages\nAcademic Press; 5 edition (September 22, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0123821002\nISBN-13: 978-0123821003 \n \n \n \nSeed Please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71951732eac44ffe173a6ba851d08727708695a","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics%2C+Fifth+Edition+-+%28PDF%29+%28KUNDU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71951732eac44ffe173a6ba851d08727708695a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,25,81,115,46,172,68,255,225,115,166,186,133,29,8,114,119,8,105,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
