Since I had been personally looking for these for a while with no luck (with the exception of the low quality YouTube rips), I immediately stuck these in my VCR-DVD recorder for transfer to DVD and encoding on PC.\n\nThese were recorded from the Australian Channel 7's breakfast TV show 'The Big Breakfast' in late 1999/early 2000. This show not only added the local time in the corner of the screen, but enclosed it with their own 'Big Breakfast' logo which also occasionally showed the weather for the day in each Australian city. Thankfully, it's not too intrusive however.\n\nI make no guarantee of the quality of these episodes, I have simply posted them here since I know many people have been looking for this series. I personally think however that the picture quality is somewhat better than the YouTube rips and has a higher resolution.\n\nUnfortunately I do not have all 40 episodes, what I have is episode 1-8 and 10-33. Other than any opening/end credits missing, I have made some notes next to the episode list below of any issues with any of the episodes.\n\nEpisode 1    Adios ZZ\nEpisode 2    Enter the Ninjzz\nEpisode 3    Blitzy's Battle Bots Brigade\nEpisode 4    Stop that Bot\nEpisode 5    Block 93\nEpisode 6    Flowers for ZZ\nEpisode 7    Rock the Corp\nEpisode 8    This Land is My Land\nEpisode 10   ZZ Come Back\nEpisode 11   Lost\nEpisode 12   Bring the Boyzz Down\nEpisode 13   Spybot\nEpisode 14   Climb the Mountain\nEpisode 15   Assault on Bunker 435\nEpisode 16   Blind Date\nEpisode 17   Grasp for Power\nEpisode 18   Bobby and his Bots\nEpisode 19   The Weapon\nEpisode 20   A Few Good Boyzzs          first 60 seconds missing &amp; some sound missing 6min - 8min\nEpisode 21   A Tale of Two Paradims\nEpisode 22   General Blitzy\nEpisode 23   The Zulander Scanner       sound issues\nEpisode 24   Mind Gamez\nEpisode 25   Island Ploy\nEpisode 26   Photo Finish\nEpisode 27   A Gift for Frenzy\nEpisode 28   ZZ and the Law\nEpisode 29   The Appointment\nEpisode 30   The Duel\nEpisode 31   The Bad Boyzzs are among us\nEpisode 32   Friendly Enemy\nEpisode 33   The Gift                   last 50 seconds missing\n\nSome technical info:\nVideo: x264, average bitrate 1200-1300kbps (encoded for video size approx 230MB), 640x480, 25fps (PAL)\nAudio: AAC 128kbps, 48kHz stereo\nContainer: MP4\nRipped from video to DVD and encoded using Avidemux 2.56 64bit\n\nthumbnails: http://bayimg.com/laellaagg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efad99fb65a912dea79c8ee0f71aeaf5fffa0cf6","amp;dn":"The+Bots+Master","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efad99fb65a912dea79c8ee0f71aeaf5fffa0cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,173,153,251,101,169,18,222,167,156,142,224,247,26,234,245,255,250,12,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
