The plant was designed to manufacture a pesticide\nthat would help Indian farmers fight crop disease, feed the poor,\nand make millions of dollars. But in just five years, the pesticide\nplant turned from a potential money-spinner into a disaster waiting\nto happen.\n\nOne Night In Bhopal exposes the financial pressures and cost-cutting\ndecisions that sacrificed the safe operation of the plant. It reveals\nthe horrific nature of MIC and the failure of the plant&amp;#039;s owners to\nwarn Bhopal&amp;#039;s citizens of the timebomb in their midst. And it tells\nthe story of the world&amp;#039;s worst industrial disaster through the eyes\nof those who lived through it including: eight-year old Shamid;\nKum Kum, a young medical graduate; Suman, a technician in the plant\nwho struggled valiantly to control the runaway reaction that was\nturning liquid chemicals into poisonous gases; Swaraj, Bhopal&amp;#039;s\nyouthful Chief of Police who organised the shocked city&amp;#039;s response\ndespite being poisoned himself; and D K Satpathy, the city&amp;#039;s\npathologist, who had the horrible task of examining the dead and\ndying.\n\nThose affected by the gas leak died hideous and painful deaths. \nToday the effects are still being felt in Bhopal, where on average \none person a day dies as a result of what happened that night 21 \nyears ago.\n\nAt the heart of the film is a vivid reconstruction of the night\ndisaster struck, including a detailed breakdown of the sequence of\nevents that propelled the city towards disaster. But the film also\naddresses broader, contemporary questions. Why have neither Union\nCarbide not the Indian authorities provided Bhopal?s citizens with\nadequate compensation? Why has no one been brought to justice for\nthe neglect that killed thousands? And, in today&amp;#039;s global economy,\ncould it happen again?\n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1928568956aad9ed0aa44261161f9d69105b699","amp;dn":"One+Night+In+Bhopal+%28Indian+Industrial+Accident%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1928568956aad9ed0aa44261161f9d69105b699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,146,133,104,149,106,173,158,208,170,68,38,17,97,249,214,145,5,182,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
