A few major benefits of this new system:\n\n1) This is to ensure that all the races of the season remain well seeded for the benefit of all. \n2) Much Higher swamp speeds overall.\n3) Only required to maintain 1 torrent for seeding instead of multiple torrents for all the previous races. \n\nNow the (minor) drawback:\n1) More hard drive space required (hard drives go for a song these days though)\n\nNow all the torrents are incremental, which means you only have to download the latest torrent when you want all the broadcasts. \nKeep your downloaded torrents in your download folder!, or else you will have to download all broadcasts again when there is a new one. \nWhen there is a new torrent, just download and open it. It will ask if you want to reload the trackers from it, tap yes. \nThe torrent will be updated and you are able to download the latest broadcast.\n\nI had to change the file format system as there will be NO ONE seeding the older races and also due to my low upstream bandwidth. \nI been getting many requests for reseeds on a daily basis and it is impossible for me to fufill all of them given my upload speed.\n\nMy sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused.\n\n===========================================================================\n\nAfter you have completed the download, Please,\n1) RATE THE TORRENT on the upper right side of the torrent page.\n2) Leave me a comment, regardless good or bad.\n\nThank You!\n\n\nCurrently releasing:\n- Formula 1\n- MotoGP\n- WRC\n- WSBK\n- BSB \n\n\n\n***** NEEDED: Swedish Seedbox &amp; Seeders with high upload speeds (&gt;10mbps) &amp; uptime (24/7) so I can release more and better torrents FASTER! *****\n\n*** Looking For ***\n- Seedbox\n- Trusted seeders with high upload speeds (You will get the files from me in private first)\nInterested users who wish to contribute please email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;adefc4c6c8defeeaedeac0ccc4c183cec2c0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAny offers would be greatly appreciated!\n\n===========================================================================\n\n\n\n\n=== Contacts ===\n\nURL: http://piratebay.org/User/SGBikes\nRSS Feed: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/4b64c98c6a7e0fb1f786570aa6803f00\nEmail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d092b9bbb5a383979097bdb1b9bcfe93bfbd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nPlease do E-Mail me if you have anything to share with me.
