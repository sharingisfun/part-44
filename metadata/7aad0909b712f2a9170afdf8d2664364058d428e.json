The Betamax tape was a \ncast member's personal copy.  (I am not equipped to make a BetaRip, sorry.)\n\n(Jim Henson's introduction (the first few seconds) were partially cut off on \nthis copy and had to be added from another source.)\n\nI cleaned it a bit, IVTC'd the progressive portion, and ripped the closed \ncaptioning to add as English subtitles.\n\nQuality is fair, but better than existing rips on the net.\n\nCover art in BMP and Nero format.\n\n(I seriously considered asking my friend to do an audio commentary track, but \nchickened out.)\n\nOther obscure info:\nLighthouse Island was filmed at Peggys Cove in Halifax.\nJim Henson had seen the location, was struck by its interesting landscape and \nrock formations and decided he wanted to film a show there.\n\nUncredited anywhere, but the Sea Monster and Tentacle were NOT built by \nHenson's people, but by Industrial Light and Magic.\n\nThe Sea Monster was operated by ILM puppeteer Kirk Thatcher who shortly after \nleft ILM to join Jim Henson Studios: http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Kirk_Thatcher\n\nAlso of note... the polar bear is a costume with a mechanical head and actor \nGordon Robinson inside.\n\nTech info:\nNTSC, DVD5, VIDEO_TS\n720x480\nEnglish DD 2.0 (256kbps)\nEnglish Subtitles (CC rip)\nNo menus\nRuntime: 25 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aad0909b712f2a9170afdf8d2664364058d428e","amp;dn":"Jim+Henson%27s+Lighthouse+Island","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aad0909b712f2a9170afdf8d2664364058d428e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,173,9,9,183,18,242,169,23,10,253,248,210,102,67,100,5,141,66,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
