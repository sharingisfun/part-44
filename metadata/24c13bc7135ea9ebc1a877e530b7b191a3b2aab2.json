Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand) is a bright, loving, but strict single parent whose distrust of rock music and fears about drug use have helped to drive a wedge between herself and her two children, Anita (Zooey Deschanel) and William (Patrick Fugit). Anita rebels by dropping out of school and becoming a stewardess, but William makes something of his love of rock &amp; roll by writing album reviews for a local underground newspaper. William's work attracts the attention of Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), editor of renegade rock magazine Creem, who takes William under his wing and gives him his first professional writing assignment -- covering a Black Sabbath concert. While William is unable to score an interview with the headliners, the opening act, Stillwater, are more than happy to chat with a reporter, even if he's still too young to drive, and William's piece on the group in Creem gains him a new admirer in Ben Fong-Torres (Terry Chen), an editor at Rolling Stone. Torres offers William an assignment for a 3,000-word cover story on Stillwater, and over the objections of his mother (whose parting words are &quot;Don't use drugs!&quot;), and after some stern advice from Bangs (who says under no circumstances should he become friends with a band he's covering), Williams joins Stillwater on tour, where he becomes friendly with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). William also becomes enamored of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a groupie traveling with the band who is no older than William, but is deeply involved with Russell. Lester Bangs and Ben Fong-Torres, incidentally, were real-life rock writers Crowe worked with closely during his days as a journalist. Almost Famous' original score was composed by Nancy Wilson of Heart (who is also Crowe's wife).\n\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson\nDIRECTOR......: Cameron Crowe\nWRITER........: Cameron Crowe\nGENRE.........: Drama | Music | Romance\nRATING........: 8.0/10 171,973 Users\nMETASCORE.....: 90/100\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/\nRUNTIME.......: 2hr 41mn\nSIZE..........: 5.97GB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264\nRESOLUTION....: 1912x1080\nBITRATE.......: 4300 kbps\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\nAUDIO2........: English Commentary \nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nSUBTITLES.....: CHI,CZE,ENG,FRE,GRE,POL,POR,SPA\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray Remux\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\nENCODE DATE...: 2014-07-28\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/3599/n3tGXf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/3599/n3tGXf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img538/848/DbRWBG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img538/848/DbRWBG.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img537/8783/tMsFK4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img537/8783/tMsFK4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/4815/LMIUd0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/4815/LMIUd0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img910/1853/iaDZJu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img910/1853/iaDZJu.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c13bc7135ea9ebc1a877e530b7b191a3b2aab2","amp;dn":"Almost.Famous.The.Bootleg.Cut.2000.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c13bc7135ea9ebc1a877e530b7b191a3b2aab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,193,59,199,19,94,169,235,193,168,119,229,48,183,177,145,163,178,170,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
