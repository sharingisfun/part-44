HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in love with his work colleague Melanie and his only friend Gary is a conspiracy theory nut.\n\nHis life is going nowhere until he has a Near Death Experience - though Death thinks of it as a Near Dave Experience. He discovers gifts he never knew he possessed and a world he never dreamed existed. A world where the Grim Reaper is a hard drinking, grumpy Billy Joel fan and the undead are bored, lonely and dangerous.\n\nHow To Be Dead is the first part in a three novella series that tells the story of Death and his office staff protecting humanity from ghosts, zombies, vampires and medium-sized apocalypses.\n\nAfter a nice cup of tea and a biscuit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:209245402a0b5cf65073c99a0a1305ebbb582b04","amp;dn":"How+to+be+Dead+-+Dave+Turner%28.epub%29%28.mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"209245402a0b5cf65073c99a0a1305ebbb582b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,146,69,64,42,11,92,246,80,115,201,154,10,19,5,235,187,88,43,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
