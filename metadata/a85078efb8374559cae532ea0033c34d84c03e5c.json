I've separated them into folders that makes for a very nice reading order, about 39 folders in all. Also includes all of Age of Ultron as of 3/15/13.\n\nAlso, while not written by Bendis, I've included the Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men crossover Utopia in the reading order. Also, whenever the Avengers books tied into another event not written by Bendis, I included the event as well.\n\nAlso included are other books by Bendis, including the start of his Marvel Now! X-Men Run\n\n- Alias 1-28\n- What If...Jessica Jones joined The Avengers?\n- Daredevil: End of Days 1-6 (of 8)\n- Daredevil: Ninja\n- Daredevil v2 16-81(includes David Mack issues)\n- Guardians of the Galaxy v3 0.1 \n- Moon Knight v4 1-12\n- Spider-Woman: Origin 1-6\n- Spider-Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D. 1-7 \n- The Pulse 1-14\n- The Pulse House of M Special\n- All-New X-Men 1-8\n- Uncanny X-Men 1-3\n\nCurrently, all this is missing is the the six issues of Elektra v2 that Bendis wrote. I plan on releasing update packs for this every few months, happy seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a85078efb8374559cae532ea0033c34d84c03e5c","amp;dn":"Avengers+and+More+by+Bendis+COMPLETE%28as+of+3%2F15%2F13%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a85078efb8374559cae532ea0033c34d84c03e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,80,120,239,184,55,69,89,202,229,50,234,0,51,195,77,132,192,62,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
