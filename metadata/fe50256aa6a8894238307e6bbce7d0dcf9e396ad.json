Fuller also serves as the show's executive producer alongside Bruce Cohen, Dan Jinks, Brooke Kennedy, Peter Ocko, and Barry Sonnenfeld.\n\nDescribed as a &quot;forensic fairy tale&quot;, Pushing Daisies is about a pie-maker with the power to bring the dead back to life. The show premiered in the United States on ABC on October 3, 2007.\n\nDue to the 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the show completed only nine episodes of a full 22-episode season. On February 11, 2008 ABC picked up Pushing Daisies for the 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“09 television season.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Pushing Daisies was nominated for twelve Emmy awards, including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (Lee Pace), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (Kristin Chenoweth), and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (Bryan Fuller). It won three, for Outstanding Direction of a Comedy Series (Barry Sonnenfeld), Outstanding Original Score (Jim Dooley), and Outstanding Editing of a Comedy Series.\n\nThe second season premiered on October 1, 2008. As ratings declined, ABC opted not to order additional episodes beyond the second season's initial thirteen. By November 20, 2008, Fuller had confirmed that ABC had cancelled Pushing Daisies, though he also mentioned the possibility of wrapping up storylines in a comic book series or a movie.\n\nThe last scheduled episode of Pushing Daisies aired on December 17, 2008, while three episodes remain unaired. ABC will reportedly air them in the summer of 2009. According to Chenoweth, these episodes will not provide a conclusion to her character's storyline.\n\nThis is its soundtrack.\n\nTrack Listing (Tracks composed by Jim Dooley):\n1. &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; - Ellen Greene (2:19)\n2. &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; - Kristin Chenoweth (3:06)\n3. &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot; - Kristin Chenoweth and Ellen Greene (3:14)\n4.
