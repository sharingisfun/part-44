It eventually leaves you with a question as to what happened to the majority of the crew of that ship when it became stranded in the Beta Hydri system.\n\nLegacy brings you the tale of those descendants of the original Pioneer colony in the Beta Hydri System, introducing for the first time, the Mystics. When Legacy is invaded by a fleet of spacecraft, the primitive colony, nine-hundred years in the making, reacts in the only way it knows how. When it comes to the Mystics, this reaction could be quite deadly.\n\nViolation finishes up the overall Ã¢â‚¬Å“introductionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the true Mystic Saga, bringing you the tale of about a dozen USSC assassins sent to a 1940Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Earth. Their sole purpose is to slip in, kill their list of targets, and slip out as quietly as possible. Unfortunately, a disgruntled soldier and a vengeful Mystic raise a significant amount of ruckus along the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be5d3cdfe0b6ff2a0f48b89f0304e6709d432cc6","amp;dn":"The+Mystic+saga+%28vol+1-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be5d3cdfe0b6ff2a0f48b89f0304e6709d432cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,93,60,223,224,182,255,42,15,72,184,159,3,4,230,112,157,67,44,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
