Legendary because it's been bootlegged so many times! \n\nHowever, unlike almost every other bootleg covering this night, I present to you the complete concert, which has never been fully broadcast on TV (the crew packed up their cameras before the second encore) or fully rebroadcast on radio (otherwise complete airings omit the Rock n Roll Medley). \n\nThe majority of this concert comes from the 2009 Mix by Queen Productions. A 45 minute edit was broadcast on the BBC, and three other tracks omitted were released as either bonus tracks on the 2011 Queen Remasters or bonus videos on the 2011 iTunes versions. Missing audio (ie between songs) was flown in from other bootlegs or the original mono mix from the video. \n\nUnfortunately, only part of the Rock and Roll medley was broadcast in the 2009 edit, so roughly the last two minutes is in crappy mono. But every other song is in high quality stereo! \n\nAlso, a snafu during Liar that was 'fixed' in 2009 has been unfixed. :) \n\nFLAC with ReplayGain metadata and cue file, however, main source was lossy audio. \n\nIntroduction\nNow I'm Here\nOgre Battle\nWhite Queen\nBohemian Rhapsody\nKiller Queen\nMarch of the Black Queen\nBohemian Rhapsody (reprise)\nBring Back That Leroy Brown\nBrighton Rock\nGuitar Solo\nSon and Daughter (reprise)\nKeep Yourself Alive\nDrum Solo\nKeep Yourself Alive (reprise)\nLiar\nIn The Lap of the Gods ...
