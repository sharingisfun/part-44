They build it, test it and they quickly figure out why it never worked. \n\nSeason 1, Episode 2:\n\n&quot;Floating Tent&quot;\nWith lakefront property harder and harder to find for campers, the idea of a floating tent seems to makes sense. The concept of camping by the lake is taken to new levels as the team expands on the ?Floating Tent? invention. The team takes the idea to the next level and sets sail with their version and goes camping on the lake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a8a62510da9bce4c0f558f7d01047363e12af49","amp;dn":"Patent.Bending.S01E02.WS.DSR.XviD-ESSENTiAL.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a8a62510da9bce4c0f558f7d01047363e12af49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,138,98,81,13,169,188,228,192,245,88,247,208,16,71,54,62,18,175,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
