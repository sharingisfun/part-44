A manhunt ensuesÃ¢â‚¬â€though the authorities arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a man they should be looking for.\nSome suspect an escapee from the White Tower, a foreboding biotech facility owned by the Godfrey familyÃ¢â‚¬â€their personal fortune and the local economy having moved on from Pittsburgh steelÃ¢â‚¬â€where, if rumors are true, biological experiments of the most unethical kind take place. Others turn to Peter Rumancek, a Gypsy trailer-trash kid who has told impressionable high school classmates that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a werewolf. Or perhaps itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Roman, the son of the late JR Godfrey, who rules the adolescent social scene with the casual arrogance of a cold-blooded aristocrat, his superior status unquestioned despite his decidedly freakish sister, Shelley, whose monstrous medical conditions belie a sweet intelligence, and his otherworldly control freak of a mother, Olivia. \nAt once a riveting mystery and a fascinating revelation of the grotesque and the darkness in us all, Hemlock Grove has the architecture and energy to become a classic in its own rightÃ¢â‚¬â€and Brian McGreevy the talent and ambition to enthrall us for years to come.\nGenre: Fantasy/Horror\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee4e822a0e12b4b937d263fa0fa3f32f2684122","amp;dn":"Hemlock+Grove+-+Brian+McGreevy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee4e822a0e12b4b937d263fa0fa3f32f2684122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,228,232,34,160,225,43,75,147,125,38,63,160,250,63,50,242,104,65,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
