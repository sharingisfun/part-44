Men Amongst Mountains (3:25)\n\nNew Orleans roots-rock band The Revivalists have been performing together for over seven years, traveling the country and honing their sound on stages and in the studio. Their latest record, Men Amongst Mountains, was recorded straight to tape in Bogalusa, LouisianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Studio in the Country, and represents a focused sound for the group.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Men Amongst Mountains is an album about growth. We set out to challenge ourselves,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said lead vocalists David Shaw. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thematically, we focused on the gentle giving way to the heavy, the acoustic to the orchestral.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:453d95606698bdff24599959a9c114302378afd0","amp;dn":"The+Revivalists+-+Men+Amongst+Mountains+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"453d95606698bdff24599959a9c114302378afd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,61,149,96,102,152,189,255,36,89,153,89,169,193,20,48,35,120,175,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
