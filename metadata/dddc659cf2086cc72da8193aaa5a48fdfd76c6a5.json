Fellow artists and lovers, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner are at the center of New YorkÃ‚Â´s 1940s art scene, but as Krasner neglects her work to push PollockÃ‚Â´s career forward, Pollock begins to unravel emotionally. Pollock and Krasner escape to the country and marry and, soon, Pollock creates work that makes him the first internationally-famous modern painter in America. But, with fame and fortune, comes a volatile temper and severe self-doubt; before long, PollockÃ‚Â´s life threatens to explode.
