This practical guide shows you how to write unit tests with Jasmine that automatically check for bugs in your application. Learn how to write specifications for individual components, and then use those specs to test the code you write.\n\nThroughout the book, author Evan Hahn focuses primarily on methods for testing browser-based JavaScript applications, but youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also discover how to use Jasmine with CoffeeScript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Ruby without Rails. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find a more in-depth source for Jasmine anywhere.\n\n- Get an overview of both test-driven and behavior-driven development\n- Write useful specs by determining what you need to testÃ¢â‚¬â€and what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\n- Test the behavior of new and existing code against the specs you create\n- Apply Jasmine matchers and discover how to build your own\n- Organize code suites into groups and subgroups as your code becomes more complex\n- Use a Jasmine spy in place of a function or an objectÃ¢â‚¬â€and learn why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s valuable\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
