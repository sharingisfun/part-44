If you have broadband then just leave my torrents on at ÃƒÂ¢?? the normal speed. You won?t notice when surfing.\nAlso be aware that it is easy to release lists of people who don?t upload afterwards and have bad upload ratios so everyone can block them and enjoy faster speeds. My favourite torrent users do it regularly so if you want to try using their lists, then read other users torrent comments.\n\nSpeed: Don&amp;#039;t complain about speeds until you have setup your network with www.portforward.com instructions?. + Don&amp;#039;t complain about free stuff. ;)\n\nSupport The Artists/Labels?:\nPlease buy direct from the label/artist. I have spent about $5,000 to date on music.\nI own these tracks. Do you?\n\nBig Up!\nThe Milky Bar Kid\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f37acafeb4391db423e7c651b9913a5e3cbb49a","amp;dn":"breaks+mix+%2B+jazz+funk+2x2hr+sessions+bbc+radio+1+%5BTMBK+2%5D+256k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f37acafeb4391db423e7c651b9913a5e3cbb49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,55,172,175,235,67,145,219,66,62,124,101,27,153,19,165,227,203,180,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
