Only\n1:1 does not keep the file(s) going as only about 90% of\nthat was useable data to others. 2:1 would be wonderful.\nIf any user does not like having to pay it forward then\ngo to a file locker. Simple as that.\n\n- Users must know how to rename a file. Not everything is\ngoing to be named how one likes as different people go by\ndifferent television episode guides. Unless there are\nnumerous sources provided to support the claim, comments\nmay possibily confuse other users. Recommended to only\nrename the file to ones own liking after seeding is done.\nAlso note that the episode name is not as important as the\nseason and episode numbers.\n\n- Users must have patience. Not everything is going to be\nreleased instantaneously. Cappers are NOT machines, they\nare real people with real lives; jobs; school; families;\nother things far more important. There are also technical\nflaws that sometimes occur in a recording which render the\nwhole video completely useless. A capper then has to wait\nfor a re-airing to attempt getting a clean recording.\n\n- Users should know that not everything is going to make it\nto their favored torrent site. There are hundreds, if not\nthousands, of websites on the internet where users can\nfind all kinds of releases with download options. Do not\nuse google to search for them! Use filestube or torrentz.\n\n- Users should know how to convert formats. Not everything\nwill be released in the format of choice. If users took\nthe time to learn how to use torrents, then they can take\na little more time to learn how to convert file formats.\nThis also goes for archive files and knowing how to mount\nor extract them. Remember, this is the internet, and there\nreally is plentiful amounts of websites on it with all the\ninformation needed to learn these things.\n\n- Try to comment on video/audio quality only or mention any\nserious technical flaws such as distorted video segments\nor major synchronization issues throughout the entire file.\nComments of commercials in the video is alright as a heads\nup to other users.\n\n\nJust remember those who provide entertainment to the users\nare volunteers doing everyone a favor. There are going to\nbe flaws as we are only human. If it's not done to a users\nsatisfaction, then they should try doing it themselves.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n- Regarding RAR files that we get from scene. Disgusted and\ntired of so many complaints about it from users yet they\nhave no idea why it is used. There have been a couple users\nattempting to explain the reason for them, but no one has\nbeen correct.\n\nIt should be common sense, but will spell it out now...\n\nIt is impossible to upload an incomplete file. It would\nhave to be written over again with each bit of progress.\nThe RAR files are so that completed parts can upload while\nthe recording and encoding is still going. The RAR files\nare how users can get some shows within 10 minutes after\nairing. And that's when it reaches P2P, the bottom of the\nsharing process. The actual release time was likely only 2\nminutes after air.\n\nThe use of RAR files is also in case there is a disruption\nin the connection while uploading. Upload can resume at the\nlast RAR part instead of starting from the beginning again.
