I like it. \nThe concert was a blast because it was weird, intense, magic, intimist. Peter talked a lot because things between songs were not working inside the band. Leading \nto some strange and hilarious moments on stage. But when the music started things were intense and filled with emotion. \nThe inclusion of a second guitar for this line up is a blessing and the right move. Songs gain a new life. Peter's voice goes to other dimensions. \nand the songs get all the emotion, rawness, power, beauty they deserve. I loved every second of music in this show. \nThe new songs are great pointing us to a new album that should be one of the best Peter has done in years. Let's hope it sees the light of day soon. \nThe pictures inside this torrent are from Blitz website and credit is assured (Rita Carmo). \n\nI would like to ask if there are any other recordings of the european dates from this tour flying around and if so could someone upload it here \nor point a direction? \n\nEnjoy, feel free to trade and share but please use mp3 just for personal use and ABOVE ALL DON'T SELL!!! \nCheers \nZiggy :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:424ece6ea1437db047d8b26a44e74a4231102039","amp;dn":"Peter+Murphy+-+2009-10-31%2C+Aula+Magna%2C+Lisboa%2C+Portugal+%5BAud+Mas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"424ece6ea1437db047d8b26a44e74a4231102039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,78,206,110,161,67,125,176,71,216,178,106,68,231,74,66,49,16,32,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
