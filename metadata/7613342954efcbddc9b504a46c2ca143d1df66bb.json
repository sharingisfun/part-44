He does it all.\n\n\nMost of these 16 tracks are vinyl &quot;rips&quot; but the last 2 tracks are\n\nanalog (mini TRS) out of a PC.  Tracks 9 and 10 were at first from \n\ncassette tape but I later splurged on the CD to reduce noise.\n\n\nTrack #6 is from one of the many fine LPs Todd produced for other \n\nbands...in this case he also wrote the tune (TUBES LP Remote Control\n\n1979)\n\n\nTracks # 15 and 16 were recorded for a Daryl Hall music series (Live\n\nfrom Daryl's House) and was recorded at the Rundgren residence on \n\nKauai. During the intro to the episode fellow Philly native Daryl says \n\nsomething like &quot;.....Todd goes his own way.&quot;\n\nThat hits it......who else would list Gilbert and Sullivan light\n\nopera as an influence.  Track #13 is Todd's contribution to\n\nRAP.  It grew on me; sometime after the initial shock of it.\n\nTodd's lyrics are about as pithy as pop lyrics get this side of 1950.\n\n\nThe unique guitar voicing on some of these are certainly Todd's own\n\ninventions as were the unusual drum sounds on his earlier LPs.\n\nTotal involvement....He wouldn't like this\n\n\n   \n\n\nBefore getting religion (aka JAZZ) Todd was a regular on my turntable \n\nalong with Zappa and Procol Harum.     Now I'M irregular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7613342954efcbddc9b504a46c2ca143d1df66bb","amp;dn":"Todd+Rundgren%2CMulti+Media+Mix%2C%281976-1993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7613342954efcbddc9b504a46c2ca143d1df66bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,19,52,41,84,239,203,221,201,181,4,164,108,44,161,67,209,223,102,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
