The film plots several days in the lives of several loosely linked characters in Forest Gate, DrewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own home neighborhood, close to East LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Olympic Park. Aaron (Ahmed) is the downtrodden deputy to small-time drug dealer Ed (Ed Skrein), a relationship which becomes strained when the latter ruthlessly pimps out crack-addicted prostitute Michelle (Anouska Mond) to a string of sleazy clients to pay for his lost cellphone. This wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be for everyone. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crackheads, prostitution, pedophiles, drugs and violence but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an incredible empathy for even the most horrible characters. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also some good humour too. The actingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastic. With some faces you know and some you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, each performance is bang on. Overall a deep, very well made film with terrific performances and a truly original style. \n\nGenre: Drama \nIMDB rating: 7.1/10 from 530 users \nDirected by: Ben Drew \nStarring: Riz Ahmed, Ed Skrein and Natalie Press \n\nRelease Name: Ill.Manors.2012.DVDRIP.XviD-BHRG \nSize: 919 MB \nVideo: XViD | 624Ãƒâ€”336 | 971 Kbps \nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 Kbps \nRuntime: 1h 56mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1c799f6d9e5f8cdf5e425347939b14fc715bee","amp;dn":"Ill.Manors.2012.DVDRIP.XviD-BHRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1c799f6d9e5f8cdf5e425347939b14fc715bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,28,121,159,109,158,95,140,223,94,66,83,71,147,155,20,252,113,91,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
