On five alternate days he answers questions put by his disciples.\nDeath and life are two polarities of the same energy, of the same phenomenon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the tide and ebb, the day and the night, the summer and the winter. They are not separate and not opposites, not contraries; they are complementaries.\nDeath is not the end of life; in fact, it is a completion of one life, the crescendo of one life, the climax, the finale.\nAnd once you know your life and its process, then you understand what death is. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Osho\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In a language simple yet profound the Master Osho indicates the art of Ã¢â‚¬Å“dyingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by learning how to live in the here and now, the eternal life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Livres Hebdo, France","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d4462e86684cd20027f1b721a1d7640b3450d1","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Dying+-+PDF+-+WD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d4462e86684cd20027f1b721a1d7640b3450d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,212,70,46,134,104,76,210,0,39,241,183,33,161,215,100,11,52,80,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
