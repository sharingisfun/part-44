These are pretty much all soundboard recordings although some may be a combination soundboard/audience. There may be some patching of gaps with lesser quality sources and some songs may have cuts or fade ins/fade outs. This is a music only download if artwork is needed you could probably find art with matching track lists online at the Zeppelin Art site. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve borrowed some comments from the Led Zeppelin database to help with descriptions.\n\nThis isn't meant to be a definitive collection as there are many awesome Led Zeppelin audience recordings out there. I was merely trying to get together a collection of great sounding live Led Zeppelin for listening and figured others may like it as well. So here it is if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested.  If you like this collection and feel that others may like it too please feel free to seed as long as possible.

Audio from the Led Zeppelin DVD.\n\n\n1975.02.12 New York, Madison Square Garden\nRobert sounds good and strong, Jonesy and Bonzo are amazing as always, and Jimmy is incendiary tonight, especially at the end of Sick Again. He extends the solo in Over The Hills And Far Away to an incredible length and soars. Moby Dick is like a hurricane and Dazed And Confused just blows everybody out to the cosmic level! A bunch of heavy solid encores with an excellent Heartbreaker with some lyrics of Elvis Presley's That's Alright Mama thrown in closing this amazing evening.This is definitely a triumph for the entire band and, not only a strong concert but also probably the best from the 1975 US Tour. This version is a Matrix blending soundboard and audience recordings.\n\n\n1975.02.13 Uniondale, NY, Nassau Coliseum\nThe band is strong, Robert's voice is in fair shape and Jimmy is blazing, especially on a great and very long version of Dazed and Confused and an epic Stairway to Heaven solo. One of the encores, Communication Breakdown, features Ronnie Wood on second guitar, dueling with Page as they trade licks in an extended jam that sounds killer when Jonesy and Bonham jam behind it. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.02.14 Uniondale, NY, Nassau Coliseum\nThis is a magical show ... one of the best from 1975!  Since I've Been Loving You is played for the first time out of three on this tour and the playing and energy of this show make it a real special concert. Plant: &quot;Who knows what it's gonna sound like, but it's something we really used to dig playing.&quot; No Quarter is great and Dazed And Confused is beyond words. The encores are funky and long, and the rare second encore of Heartbreaker has a long blues interlude inserted in Jimmy's solo. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.02.16 St. Louis, Missouri Arena\nThe show itself is an excellent closing night for the first half of the tour. During his intro for The Song Remains The Same, Plant refers to Kansas City and that John Bonham was arrested there once! Before No Quarter John Paul Jones is finishing a gin and tonic before he can start playing and tonight's version is very strong, sounding very dark and foreboding. Dazed And Confused and Stairway To Heaven are both outstanding. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.02.28 Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University\nA great show from 1975!  The show itself is wonderful ... Robert is in good voice (something that doesn't happen often in 1975), and the band is amazing. Start to finish this show is great ... even the long Moby Dick is enjoyable.  No Quarter is a wonderful jam with some excellent piano from Jonesy and Kashmir is epic. Dazed And Confused is long and great, and the drumming, in particular, is immense. This is also the date on which Physical Graffiti was finally released in the United States.  Soundboard (The sound is rough at the start of Rock And Roll but soon improves and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great sounding soundboard show).\n\n\n1975.03.04 Dallas, Memorial Auditorium\nThis is one of the best if not the best recording board as for the sound. Robert's voice is in pretty bad shape, but the instrumental machine is playing fine. Jones and Bonham in particular are wonderful, with Bonham reaching a peak of playing in Sick Again and In My Time Of Dying that is staggering. No Quarter could be a fine version but is cut. Trampled Underfoot is outstanding and vocal lyrics near the end are awesome. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.05 Dallas, Memorial Auditorium\nTrampled Underfoot is very heavy and a great version and Dazed And Confused is intense and very long. The Crunge is inserted in Whole Lotta Love and is very funky and fast and leads into a monstrous Black Dog. Robert's voice is very strong and solid and he performs some great vocal variations in In My Time Of Dying and Kashmir. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.11 Long Beach, Civic Arena\nThis show has some amazing playing but the crowd seems more interested in sleeping than the crushing music. This seems unbelievable, to be lucky enough to see Led Zeppelin and to react in this way. Robert slams the crowd for their reactions, but in reality, this show is great.  Robert dedicates The Song Remains The Same to the bootleggers: &quot;For the benefit of anyone who was making a bootleg then - the 12-string was out of tune!&quot;   Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.14 San Diego, San Diego Sports Arena\nA mixed performance. In some points the band reaching a peak of their playing, in other they are just average and rather sloopy. The hardest accent belongs to the opening numbers, after that the band seems to be a bit tired and that caused of lack of soarning during improvisation sections in No Quarter and Dazed And Confused.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over The Hills And Far AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ again contains an excellent Jimmy Page solo in the middle and in the final reiteration of the folk theme he includes a reference to Ã¢â‚¬Å“White Summer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  This is logical since the main theme comes from the old classic. Before Ã¢â‚¬Å“In My Time Of DyingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Plant says cryptically, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sorry about the very slight delay tonight, but apparently it was snowing in Austria, which has got a lot to do with San Diego, right?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  Plant is very impressive on this song as he storms the gates of heaven.  Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.17 Seattle, Seattle Coliseum\nA really superb show from the 1975 Tour. The sound is great and the playing is excellent. Robert is in decent voice and the band is on a roll! No Quarter and Dazed And Confused are some of the best versions ever, and he opening numbers are really powerful. The earlier shows on the tour like the New York shows were long, but the marathons were generally played at 1973 length (No Quarter never exceeding twenty minutes, Dazed never exceeding thirty). In the west coast shows Zeppelin expands the numbers to where a thirty minute No Quarter and a forty-minute Dazed And Confused are routine.  Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.19 Vancouver, Canada\nThe playing is on top form and overall all the songs were performed with furiosity. Pagey is in decent form tonight, with especially fine playing on Sick Again, In My Time Of Dying and The Song Remains The Same; Plant is not in fine form, though, with his best vocals coming from the songs that demanded the least from him, such as No Quarter and Whole Lotta Love; Bonham does bring the bang, with awesome drumming on Over The Hills And Far Away, Kashmir and Trampled Underfoot. Ironically, it is Jones that makes this show awesome, with amazing bass playing and great keyboards from start to finish. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.03.20 Vancouver, Canada\nNo Quarter is absolutely beautiful and Dazed And Confused rocks really hard and is led by Jimmy's amazing guitar prowess. Stairway To Heaven really lifts off during the guitar solo and the heavily improvised and dynamic encores close out this really heavy, powerful and exciting show. Listen to the Whole Lotta Love encore for Lickin' Stick followed by the riffs from Ozone Baby, three years before it's recording. Soundboard.\n\n\n1975.05 London, Earls Court Arena\nSix songs. All are from the 25th except for In My Time Of Dying which is taken from the 24th. Audio from the Led Zeppelin DVD.\n\n\n1975.05.24 London, Earls Court Arena\nThis is a monster of a show. The best of the five Earl's Court gigs, this show has the band reaching a peak for 1975. No Quarter must be the best version ever recorded, and Dazed and Confused is an incredible journey.  Audio from video soundtrack or soundboard.\n\n\n1975.05.25 London, Earls Court Arena\nThe final Earl's Court show, the final 1975 show, and the last ever performance of Dazed and Confused. The initial string of numbers are high powered and aggressive! No Quarter is a really great jam and the acoustic section is pretty good. The Stairway to Heaven solo is wonderful and the encores contain a tortured Theremin solo from Jimmy before the extra songs are played for the last night's sake. This version is a Matrix blending soundboard and audience recordings.\n\n\nFeel free to share with anyone anytime anywhere.\nSeed if possible.
