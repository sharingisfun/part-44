While the songwriting may not be as exceptional as future releases, and Steven Tyler's singing style wasn't fully developed yet, the album succeeds on the band's raw, loose and bluesy performance. The now legendary quintet was unfairly labeled as a Stones/N.Y. Dolls rip-off at the time, but Aerosmith was more technically proficient at their instruments than the Dolls, and was much more hard rock-based than the Stones (i.e., Led Zeppelin, Yardbirds, etc.). Aerosmith spawned one of the first true rock ballads ever, the reflective &quot;Dream On&quot; (a hit single when re-released in 1976), while the rocking &quot;Mama Kin&quot; was one of the band's best early anthems, receiving further attention after Aero-disciples Guns N' Roses covered it on 1989's G N' R Lies. Other tracks, such as &quot;Make It,&quot; &quot;Somebody,&quot; &quot;One Way Street,&quot; &quot;Write Me,&quot; and &quot;Walking the Dog&quot; serve as the perfect snapshot of the young band finding their foothold, while the oft-overlooked, long-and-winding storyteller, &quot;Movin' Out,&quot; remains one of Aerosmith's all-time best. Aerosmith is one of their \n most underrated records. \n \n \n  Track Listing....: \n 01.Make it [03:40] \n 02.Somebody [03:45] \n 03.Dream on [04:28] \n 04.One way street [07:02] \n 05.Mama kin [04:29] \n 06.Write me [04:12] \n 07.Movin' out [05:02] \n 08.Walkin' the dog [03:12] \n ____ \n \n 35:50 min \n 54,3 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c739a84e61a1965c2b91de65b6a22d70f759309","amp;dn":"Aerosmith-Aerosmith-%28Retail%29-1973-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c739a84e61a1965c2b91de65b6a22d70f759309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,115,154,132,230,26,25,101,194,185,29,230,91,106,34,215,15,117,147,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
