Everybody In This Town\n2. Workin' On It\n3. The Twenty Dollar Bill\n4. Backenforth\n5. 200 Miles Away\n6. The Jon Stokes Prison Break Blues\n7. Who On Earth\n8. Backseat\n\nCody DiekhoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wryly aphoristic, darkly amusing country-folk songcraft evokes icons like John Prine and Steve Earle while it fits in with the top tier of current-day Americana artists like fellow Chicagoan Joe Pug. Recorded under DiekhoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performing name Chicago Farmer, his new album Backenforth, IL is just out and it tells a catchy bunch of tales. In a big city, his misfit characters would be called nonconformists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a a rural area, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more likely to be considered smalltime criminals, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a soft spot for them.\n\nThe opening track, Everybody in This Town is the musical standout here. It sounds like the Wallflowers backing John Prine, with a Joe Day organ break thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beyond gorgeous, something that keyboardists will be nicking years from now. Drawling over it, Dieckhoff contemplates the rougher side of smalltown life and how everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business is everybody elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.\n\nThe next track is Working on It, a swaying honkytonk tune with some tasty dobro. A song that breaks the fourth wall might not be the first thing you would think of in country music but this one does, and it works. A stoner folk tune with bite, The Twenty Dollar Bill at first seems like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to turn into a sentimental tale about missing the old folks but takes quickly an unexpected turn thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too good to spoil here.\n\nWith its bubbling pedal steel and brisk bluegrass shuffle beat, Backenforth is another song that at first sounds a lot more happy and laid-back than it turns out to be. The swaying, all-acoustic 200 Miles Away is a mystery story, with a country-blues feel like the stuff thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been coming out of Brooklyn lately. The best tale of all of them here is The Jon Stokes Prison Break Blues, a scampering account of a smalltime crook who busts out of jail, with some unexpected punchlines Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a story worthy of Woody Guthrie.\n\nThe edgiest song here, another one that brings to mind Woody Guthrie, is Who on Earth, a scathing broadside directed at holier-than-thou hypocrites:\n\nI got a ticket for a busted headlight\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 11 AM, sunny and bright\nLimitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 55, I was doing 57\nNow I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get into heaven\n\nAnd it gets better from there. The album ends with Backseat, a jaunty country-folk shuffle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b33b2c72169711ec1bbc9f88d59ee9311a839a7d","amp;dn":"Chicago+Farmer+-+Backenforth%2C+IL+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b33b2c72169711ec1bbc9f88d59ee9311a839a7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,59,44,114,22,151,17,236,27,188,159,136,213,158,233,49,26,131,154,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
