While this drama based on the life of supermodel Gia Curangi tells us that the greatest love of Gia's life was a woman, she also had heterosexual relationships, and she also experimented with less benevolent things available in abundance to celebrities (and perhaps to many others?).\n\nIt seems to me that HBO pictures to a greater degree than most drama and documentary film companies, keeps a high quality profile. This one certainly is a strong drama and I think Jolie does better here than in any other film in which I've seen her. But judge for yourselves.\n\nDetails\nFull, uncompressed full quality dvd 5 (PAL)\nSpoken language: English\nSubtitles: none\nVideo aspect ratio: 4:3\nDolby Digital stereo\nFeature length: 119 minutes\nNo special features\n\nHigh-resolution dvd cover included.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f851f09feb93d7c3b72e333b8d461b7c0c3e1662","amp;dn":"Gia+%28drama+w.+Angelina+Jolie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f851f09feb93d7c3b72e333b8d461b7c0c3e1662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,81,240,159,235,147,215,195,183,46,51,59,141,70,27,124,12,62,22,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
