Premium format Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with bonus gifts, posters or supplements Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each special edition tackles a single topic with features, guides and interviews. Previous editions have reviewed every Joss Whedon TV episode, gone behind the scenes on Lost, and analysed the vampire phenomenon. Join us six times a year and get a fantastically detailed magazine plus gifts and supplements (which vary by issue) that celebrate your favourite genre passions.\n\nEnglish | 124 pages | HQ PDF | 100.00 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988e0635856a67e1eb12644f2e604c5ad236f8ec","amp;dn":"SFX+Collection+Issue+57%2C+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988e0635856a67e1eb12644f2e604c5ad236f8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,142,6,53,133,106,103,225,235,18,100,79,46,96,76,90,210,54,248,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
