Two of the four songs find them switching back and forth while the other two are strictly flute features. With pianist Tommy Flanagan, guitarist Joe Puma, bassist Wendell Marshall and drummer Bobby Donaldson contributing quiet support, the two lead voices constantly interact and trade off during this enjoyable performance. Highpoints are the haunting &quot;Tel Aviv&quot; and a delightful version of &quot;Chasing the Bird.&quot;\n\n\n01 - Tel Aviv\n02 - Somewhere Else\n03 - Let's March\n04 - Chasin' the Bird","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a423837fd6d73224496f5a4cc167c5c02c26ee6","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+%26amp%3B+Bobby+Jaspar+-+Flute+Souffle+%281957%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a423837fd6d73224496f5a4cc167c5c02c26ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,66,56,55,253,109,115,34,68,150,245,164,204,22,124,92,2,194,110,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
