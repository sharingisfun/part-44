The EP will contain four tracks, &amp;#039;Save Your Soul,&amp;#039; &amp;#039;A Hundred Kisses,&amp;#039; &amp;#039;Sugar,&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Sleep.&amp;#039;\n\nTheir new EP, &amp;#039;Save Your Soul,&amp;#039; was released to iTunes on May 13, 2008. [6]&quot;\n\n**Note**\n\nThere is an additional file in this torrent, Timbaland&amp;#039;s &quot;Time,&quot; which has a brilliance added to it thanks to SWR.\n\n\nI only share the music I think the world needs to hear. Notice how few torrents I have posted.\n\nPlease do consider paying for their music. I own both albums. If they&amp;#039;d put this out on disc, I&amp;#039;d surely buy it, but they&amp;#039;re being dumb.\n\nSo here you are, enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31598c01b6b3341a8b6f32362bd1e829895f062d","amp;dn":"She+Wants+Revenge+-+Save+Your+Soul+%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31598c01b6b3341a8b6f32362bd1e829895f062d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,89,140,1,182,179,52,26,139,111,50,54,43,209,232,41,137,95,6,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
