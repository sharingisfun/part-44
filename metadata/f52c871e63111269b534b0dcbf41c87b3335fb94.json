Recorded in part with a ten-piece orchestra, the record is closer to chamber pop than roots rock, with the bright, sunny songs adorned in piano and horns; tracks like &quot;Monkey Suit&quot; and &quot;Clear Spot&quot; are instantly engaging, their sheer hummability alone suggesting not merely a radical creative reassessment but a total artistic rebirth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52c871e63111269b534b0dcbf41c87b3335fb94","amp;dn":"Pernice+Brothers+-+Overcome+By+Happiness+%5B1998%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52c871e63111269b534b0dcbf41c87b3335fb94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,44,135,30,99,17,18,105,181,52,176,220,191,65,200,123,51,53,251,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
