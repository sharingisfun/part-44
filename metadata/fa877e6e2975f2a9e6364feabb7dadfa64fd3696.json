Walpole\nRaymond H. Myers, Virginia Polytechnic Institute\nSharon L. Myers\nKeying Ye, Virginia Polytechnical Institute and State University\n\nFor junior/senior undergraduates taking probability and statistics as it applied to engineering, science or computer science.\n \nWith its unique balance of theory and methodology, this classic text provides a rigorous introduction to basic probability theory and statistical inference that is motivated by interesting, relevant applications. Extensively updated coverage, new problem sets, and chapter-ending material extend the textÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s relevance to a new generation of engineers and scientists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa877e6e2975f2a9e6364feabb7dadfa64fd3696","amp;dn":"Probability+and+Statistics+for+Engineers+and+Scientists.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa877e6e2975f2a9e6364feabb7dadfa64fd3696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,135,126,110,41,117,242,169,230,54,79,234,187,125,173,250,100,253,54,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
