A picture of a bearded guru in white robes sits at\nthe front of the room with a tiny offering of fresh flowers. There\nare 14 students, and they have come here to learn to breathe.\nKnown as the Art of Living, this intensive breathing course will\nlast six days. The class has drawn people ranging in age from\ntheir 20s to their 60s.\nThere is a builder, a businessman, a masseuse, an acupuncturist\nand a Jacuzzi engineer. It includes some who are seeking relief\nfrom asthma, chronic pain and depression and others who have\ncome because they heard about it from a friend. One man came\nafter seeing a flier at a Whole Foods market.\nStudents of the Art of Living program say the breathing technique\ncan bring greater awareness, a fuller and happier life, less stress,\ngreater mental focus, and a bevy of other health benefits. But\nthere is scant research so far to support those claims.\nNow, a handful of doctors and psychiatrists in this country are\ntouting the benefits of the special breathing technique taught in\nthe Art of Living course to help relieve depression, post-traumatic\nstress disorder, insomnia and anxiety.\nOne of those is Dr. Richard Brown, an associate professor of\nclinical psychiatry at Columbia UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s College of Physicians\nand Surgeons.\nAfter Brown published a book in 1999 about holistic approaches\nto depression, people from the Art of Living contacted him and\nexplained their program. Impressed with what he heard, Brown\nlater began recommending the program to many of his patients.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMany of them were transformed,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Brown says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect\nthat.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nBrown eventually took the Art of Living course, then started\nteaching the program to, among others, fellow mental health\nprofessionals in New York.\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also become the main spokesman in the medical community\nfor Art of Living.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eccf58a7d82c556e826b8e7b13ff4a607fedb9e","amp;dn":"Sudarshan+Kriya+-+Sri+Sri+Ravi+Shankar+-+Los+Angeles_Times_Art_o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eccf58a7d82c556e826b8e7b13ff4a607fedb9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,204,245,138,125,130,197,86,232,38,184,231,177,63,244,166,7,254,219,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
