This approach gives students the foundation they need to understand the logic behind program design and to establish effective programming skills.\n\nThis edition has been fully revised to offer students a lively and accessible presentation as they learn core programming concepts, such as data types, control structures, data files and arrays and program design techniques, such as top-down modular design and proper program documentation and style. Problem-solving skills are developed when students learn how to use basic programming tools and algorithms which include data validation, defensive programming, calculating sums and averages, and searching and sorting lists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76bf0ddd7af7d46528f35f4e9bbc17d759cbda01","amp;dn":"Extended+Prelude+to+Programming%3A+Concepts+and+Design+-+3rd+Editi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76bf0ddd7af7d46528f35f4e9bbc17d759cbda01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,191,13,221,122,247,212,101,40,243,95,78,155,188,23,215,89,203,218,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
