But it's still perfectly listenable, and it's very rare, so this is better than nothing!\n\nTook me a long time to find.  Hope you enjoy it too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e8133f3419d58804483820860fe10b8a6afad7","amp;dn":"Hoodlum+Priest+-+Beneath+The+Pavement...The+Beach+%281994%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81e8133f3419d58804483820860fe10b8a6afad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,232,19,63,52,25,213,136,4,72,56,32,134,15,225,11,138,106,250,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
