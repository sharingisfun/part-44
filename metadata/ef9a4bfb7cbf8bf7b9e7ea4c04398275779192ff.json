At the forefront of the band are its two original members: multi instrumentalist Nathan Howdeshell, who tackles bass, lead guitar and synths, and Beth Ditto, the explosively dynamic frontwoman who has become a cultural icon with her diva-worthy voice and electrifying stage antics. Add drummer Hannah Blilie and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got a trio that really mean business.\n\nThe indie group for Portland, Oregan have teamed up with legendary producer Rick Rubin (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run-DMC and Johnny Cash among many others) to produce an unrelenting tour-de-force of rump-shaking punk rock. Led by the lead single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeavy CrossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, this is a hot album that you can listen to in full right now.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1 Dimestore diamond\n2 heavy cross\n3 8th wonder\n4 love long distance\n5 pop goes the world\n6 vertical rhythm\n7 men in love\n8 for keeps\n9 2012\n10 love and let love\n11 four letter word\n12 spare me from the mold\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9a4bfb7cbf8bf7b9e7ea4c04398275779192ff","amp;dn":"Gossip+-+Music+For+Men+%5BCD+2009%5D+%5BAll+Cov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef9a4bfb7cbf8bf7b9e7ea4c04398275779192ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,154,75,251,124,191,139,247,185,231,234,76,4,57,130,117,119,145,146,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
