A truly useful textbook, she felt, would have ways to help students find the information they were seeking without having to know the terminology, would be clear and easy to understand for all students, and would be written in a student-friendly language and tone to avoid the intimidating formal instructional tone of some handbooks. These principles became the foundation of HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Prentice Hall Reference Guide.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface v\nCompare and Correct Question and Correct\nWriting Processes\nWriting for College and Career\nRevising Sentences for Accuracy, Clarity, and Variety\nParts of Sentences\nStyle and Word Choice\nPunctuation\nMechanics and Spelling\nFor Multilingual Writers\nResearch\nMLA Documentation\nAPA, CM, and CSE Documentation\nGlossary of Grammatical Terms 509\nIndex 531","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6352fb321e5d3f6c3b6933bc2cf2b1d9b4db92c","amp;dn":"Prentice+Hall+Reference+Guide+%288th+Edition%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6352fb321e5d3f6c3b6933bc2cf2b1d9b4db92c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,53,47,179,33,229,211,246,195,182,147,59,194,207,43,29,155,77,185,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
