They have two hugely successful Edinburgh festivals under their belt where they started out as relative unknowns to secure many 5-star reviews from critics and a loyal fan base. This year the group make their debut on BBC 7 with a brand new four part radio series that tells the extraordinary life stories of four Faversham brothers - Horatius, Victorian Britain's most decorated soldier; Theseus, a detective even more famous than Sherlock Holmes; Leonidas, an explorer who left no corner of the Empire untouched and Augustus, the man who became Victorian Britain's most celebrated magician. \n\n\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......The Brothers Faversham  - S01 - E01 - Horatius \nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......The Brothers Faversham  - S01 - E02 - Theseus\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......The Brothers Faversham  - S01 - E03 - Leonidas\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......The Brothers Faversham  - S01 - E04 - Augustus\n\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......More Brothers Faversham - S02 - E01 - Titus\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......More Brothers Faversham - S02 - E02 - Maximillian\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......More Brothers Faversham - S02 - E03 - Marcus\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......More Brothers Faversham - S02 - E04 - Perceus And Lucius\n\nThe Penny Dreadfuls Present......Guy Fawkes - Special @ 45 Minutes\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5945f23e010ccfbd5fb6fbd10f636e2fc8a901","amp;dn":"Penny+Dreadfuls+Present...Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5945f23e010ccfbd5fb6fbd10f636e2fc8a901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,89,69,242,62,1,12,207,189,95,182,251,209,15,99,110,47,200,169,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
