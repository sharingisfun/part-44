Rock Hudson as president begins negotiations with Soviet officials, hoping to prevent World War III.\n\nCredits \nCast: Rock Hudson \nDirector: David Greene \n\nSynopsis\nAfter the U.S. organizes a grain embargo against the Soviet Union, soldiers of the latter superpower retaliate by crossing the Bering Strait to block the Alaskan pipeline.\n\nThe U.S. Army sends its own troops to the eastern side of the pipeline. The Soviet and American conventional forces prepare to face off against one another. Now it's up to the leaders of each nation to consider two options.\n\nEach can either come to the negotiating table... or launch a global thermonuclear attack...\n\nFilm Notes\nThis two-part miniseries originally aired on television. Tragically, the production's original director, Boris Sagal, was killed during the on-location shoot in Alaska. Producers declared the rest of the film would be completed on indoor sets. Some critics found the ersatz &quot;locations&quot; unconvincing and jarring compared to the authentic settings featured in other sequences.\n\nFormat: VHS\nJun 1987\nNot Rated\nRecording Mode: Stereo\nSound: HiFi, Stereo\nClosed Captioned\n186 min.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:961c662a62f1bfd7c61bb44f62c25f3cfdf20b20","amp;dn":"World+War+III+-+Rock+Hudson-80%60s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"961c662a62f1bfd7c61bb44f62c25f3cfdf20b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,28,102,42,98,241,191,215,198,27,180,79,98,194,95,60,253,242,11,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
