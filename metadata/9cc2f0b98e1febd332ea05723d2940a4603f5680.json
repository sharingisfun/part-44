The original concept was that, in months when the WWF was not running one of its major PPV events (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble, which at the time ran for three hours and retailed for $29.95), they would offer a two-hour PPV, priced at $19.95. This concept was somewhat abandoned when World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began offering three-hour PPV events on a monthly basis, forcing the WWF to do the same.\n\nThe events were numbered, as In Your House #1, #2, and so on, until event specific subtitles were added, such as &quot;It's Time&quot; (Vader's catchphrase), &quot;Buried Alive&quot; (describing the main event match), &quot;A Cold Day In Hell&quot; (contrasting gimmicks of main eventers Steve Austin and The Undertaker), &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; (The Rock's finishing move and the decline of his opponent Mankind), &quot;In Your House St. Valentine's Day Massacre&quot; (a violent event taking place in February and the PPV happened on Valentine's Day), and many others. Gradually the subtitles became main titles (whereas the PPV was not named In Your House: Fully Loaded but Fully Loaded: In Your House), until the regular named shows took over, with the current No Way Out, Backlash, Judgment Day and Unforgiven stemming from them.\n\n\n____TORRENT INFO____\nIn Your House was never legitimately distributed to the public except for a few of the events on Coliseum Video VHS. This is a rare, unreleased collection in HD, thanks to the WWE Network and days of ripping. This contains all 28 events.\n\n\n____MEDIA INFO____\nSource: WWE Network\nResolution: 960x720.\nAspect Ratio: 16:9.\nCodec: x264. \nBitrate: 3,000Kbps.\nBitrate Mode: Variable.\nFramerate: 29.970.\nFramerate Mode: Constant.\nReference Frames: 3.\nBit Depth: 8-bits.\nChroma: 4:2:0.\nAudio: AAC-LC.\nAudio Channels: 2.\nAudio Sampling: 48.0 KHz.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc2f0b98e1febd332ea05723d2940a4603f5680","amp;dn":"WWE.In.Your.House.COMPLETE.720p.WEBRip.x264-ClintCox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc2f0b98e1febd332ea05723d2940a4603f5680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,194,240,185,142,31,235,211,50,234,5,114,61,41,64,164,96,63,86,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
