The shows performed there actually set the mark for how amazing the band could be live.  This particular show definitely does just that.  Long rumoured to be stolen directly from Bill GrahamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vaults, this show has everything a Zephead could want  and so much more.  Pure Psychodelia with a mixture of raw power make for a Red  Hot set.  Every member of the band is in fine shape and turns in an inspired performance.  RobertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice sounds amazing and the rest of the group are as tight as can be.  Halfway through this recording John Paul JoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bass Amp blows up but he somehow manages to get through the rest of the gig.\n\nUpon writing this review I sat down and compared this version to the Empress Valley release Listen To The Difference and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m leaning towards this release sounding a bit cleaner.  ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a bit more body and depth to this release which definitely takes it to another level.  This recording has long been thought to be a soundboard recording due to how well balanced the instruments are.  RobertÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice is a bit lower than everyone else.    Coming from two microphones placed directly on stage could explain why his voice is a bit lower.  The instruments are picked up well but the microphones are placed behind the throw of the main PA speakers.\n\nThe packaging is the standard Godfather Gatefold packaging with 3 panels.  All contain great period shots of the band both on and off stage.   Mr. Paul De Luxe contributes another essay to the inside panel.  GodfatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advantage over alot of other labels is that their packaging is always simple and to the point, all the while looking just as exciting and as professional as many of the boutique labels.\n\nThis source was previously released on LP as The Rising Of The Zeppelin (no label) &amp; San Francisco ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“69 (no label) and on CD as Best Of 1969 Tour (Forever Standard Series), Black Beauty (Wendy Records), Blues Anytime (Empress Valley Supreme Disc),  Cabala (CD Company SRL), Conquering California(Dinopower Records), Cracker Jack Blues (Jelly Roll), The Dancing Avocado (Small Fish CD-R), The Dancing Avocado - Supreme Edition (Small Fish CD-R), Fillmore 69(House Of Elrond), Fillmore West (Last Stand Disc), Fillmore West 1969 (Scorpio), Fillmore West - January And April 1969 (Aulica), Go West Young Man!
