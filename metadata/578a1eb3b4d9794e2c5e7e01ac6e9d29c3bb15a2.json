Wolner\nEnglish | 2011 | ISBN: 0226905616 | 400 pages | PDF | 8,4 MB\n\nWhen championing the commercial buildings and homes that made the Windy City famous, one canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but mention the brilliant names of their architectsÃ¢â‚¬â€Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright, among others. But few people are aware of Henry Ives Cobb (1859Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1931), the man responsible for an extraordinarily rich chapter in the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turn-of-the-century building boom, and fewer still realize CobbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lasting importance as a designer of the private and public institutions that continue to enrich ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exceptional architectural heritage.\n\nHenry Ives CobbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chicago is the first book about this distinguished architect and the magnificent buildings he created, including the Newberry Library, the Chicago Historical Society, the Chicago Athletic Association, the Fisheries Building for the 1893 WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fair, and the Chicago Federal Building. Cobb filled a huge institutional void with his inventive Romanesque and Gothic buildingsÃ¢â‚¬â€something that the other architect-giants, occupied largely with residential and commercial work, did not do. Edward W. Wolner argues that these constructions and the enterprises they housedÃ¢â‚¬â€including the first buildings and master plan for the University of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â€signaled that the city had come of age, that its leaders were finally pursuing the highest ambitions in the realms of culture and intellect.\n\nAssembling a cast of colorful characters from a free-wheeling age gone by, and including over 140 images of CobbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most creative buildings, Henry Ives CobbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chicago is a rare achievement: a dynamic portrait of an architect whose institutional designs decisively changed the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity during its most critical phase of development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578a1eb3b4d9794e2c5e7e01ac6e9d29c3bb15a2","amp;dn":"Henry+Ives+Cobbs+Chicago+%28Architecture+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578a1eb3b4d9794e2c5e7e01ac6e9d29c3bb15a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,138,30,179,180,217,121,78,44,94,126,1,172,110,157,41,195,187,21,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
