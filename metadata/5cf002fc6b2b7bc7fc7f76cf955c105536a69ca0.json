For years after her daughter, Bonnie, was stolen from her, she fought for closure. When her mother, Sandra, asks Eve to find a missing friend named Beth Avery, she wants to help but is sure that Sandra is hiding something. The fact that she adamantly refuses to go to the police reinforces EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspicions that something is very wrong. Eve learns that Beth has been locked away in a mental hospital for years, which makes it even harder to understand how she could have disappeared. As Sandra reluctantly reveals small pieces of the truth about BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity, Eve is shocked to discover that their lives are strangely entwined, and BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance now puts them all in grave danger. Desperate, Eve enlists a secret weapon to pick up BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trail: rogue profiler Kendra Michaels. With an uncanny ability to detect clues and solve puzzles, Kendra begins to uncover the bizarre circumstances of BethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s escape from what should have been the safety of her hospital room. Beth is on the run, and as her mind clears Ã¢â‚¬â€œ detoxing from the drugs that have held her prisoner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she begins to see the threads of a twisted plot within the powerful Avery family, threatening to destroy her and anyone else who might jeopardize the high-stakes game that is already in play.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
