As vehement and unapologetic as their creator, the songs on the Calgary bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vikrecordings/BMG Canada Inc. May 18th debut, Draghdad are an intense build of hard rock, industrial reinforcement, stand-out lyrics, and big, catchy, killer choruses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1fadf2eb4125ba12e971e9cbb20101feef6012e","amp;dn":"Out+Of+Your+Mouth+-+Draghdad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1fadf2eb4125ba12e971e9cbb20101feef6012e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,250,223,46,180,18,91,161,46,151,30,156,187,32,16,31,238,246,1,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
