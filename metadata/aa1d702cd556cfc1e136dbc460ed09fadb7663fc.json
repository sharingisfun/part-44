In this book, Carl Sagan Sagan provides a skeptical analysis of several kinds of superstition, fraud, pseudoscience and religious beliefs, such as gods, witches, UFOs and faith healing. However, based on &quot;some experimental support,&quot; Sagan calls for serious scrutiny of a handful of seemingly inexplicable phenomena such as reincarnation and psychokinesis, not because he regards them as likely to be true, but because anomalous data deserves close scientific study.\n\n\nDuration - 14.5 hours.\n\n\nContents\n\nPreface: My Teachers\n1.
