And Grant will take a turn\ninvestigating one on one with each of his team members. This is where Grant went on his honeymoon. What a place for one of Grant's last cases.\n\nThis historic hotel offered plenty of experiences during the last investigations: crystal clear EVP, glass being thrown and loads of personal encounters.\nIn room 314, where the team caught the EVP last time, guests claimed to see and feel a woman in Victorian garb sit on the bed. In the south tower, people\nhave seen apparitions and heard footsteps. Craig, the manager, is opening Bretton Arms, the home across the street from the hotel, to the team. Here a staff\nmember saw a white glowing woman floating towards the fireplace, and guests have seen full-bodied apparitions in the hallway.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57ba03104d4a0ffde2e7f65efa92eab2d608eb7c","amp;dn":"Ghost+Hunters+S08E11+HDTV+x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57ba03104d4a0ffde2e7f65efa92eab2d608eb7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,186,3,16,77,74,15,253,226,231,246,94,250,146,234,178,214,8,235,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
