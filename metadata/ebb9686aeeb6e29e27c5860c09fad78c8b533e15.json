What it does is, makes BG1 use the engine from BG2, which is more advanced and gives more gameplay options.\n\nAfter that I've researched all the fixes and worthwhile mods that work 100% with TUTU version and compiled them in. I've kept it clean, as in, no hardcore mods or stuff that just plainly doesn't fit the world. The game holds true to the original, just being expanded and tweaked for the better.\n\nI've included the G3 widescreen mod so you can enjoy BG1 greatness in your native screen resolution. Tested up to 1080pworking, no crashes.\n\nThe game is in English.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe TUTU extension.\nhttp://www.pocketplane.net/tutu\n\nI followed the guide at Gibberlings3 to ensure I have 100% compatibility with all the mods.\nhttp://www.gibberlings3.net\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to use the release.\n\nFirst unpack the game to your desired folder.\n\nBrowse to the game folder and edit &quot;baldur.ini&quot; file. \n\nScroll to the following section and change the paths accordingly.\n\n\nHD0:=e:bgtutu\t\t#This is main installation folder\n\n\nNow run the BGConfig.exe and configure the game according to your system specs.\nComputers dating from year 1999 and on should handle the game on highest settings.\nThe config tool will ask you to test video settings. Agree on that and depending \non your settings you should see an RGB pattern. If the screen flickers during the test\nthen the game has issues with 3D acceleration. Ignore that for the moment and disable the acceleration.\nRun the test again and now the flickering should be gone.\n\nNow find &quot;setup-widescreen.exe&quot; file and run it. Using this we will setup the game engine to display in your native resolution.\nNot doing so, unless you own a crt monitor, will result in &quot;muddy&quot; graphics.\n\nLet's get thru the widescreen config. You'll be presented with several options to choose from, as follows.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nChoose your language:\n 0 [English]\n 1 [Francais (Isaya)]\n\n0 for english\n\nUsing Language [English]\n\nWould you like to display the readme?

Save the file and you are ready to enjoy the game now.\n\nRun it and see if the menus flicker. If they do there are several methods of dealing with it.\nFirst is to disable 3D acceleration. This will take out some eye candy and make some stuff look ugly.\nSecond thing you might try is to turn on antialiasing. This have helped some people.\nThird you might want to try different driver versions for your graphics card.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIX &amp; MOD list\n\n1 Pixel Productions\n1 Pixel Productions Avatars\n1 Pixel Productions Female Dwarves\n1 Pixel Productions Thieves Galore\naTweaks\nAshes Of Embers\nBG1 NPC Project\nBG1 NPC Project Music\nBG1 Unfinished Business\nBGQE Mini Quests and Encounters\nBGT Worldmap\nDing0's Tweak Pack\nDrizzt is Not Stupid\nEasy TUTU Spawn Randomizer\nFull Plate And Packing Steel\nHard Times\nHerbs &amp; Potions\nImproved BAM's\nLearn Through Use\nLost Items\nMix Mod\nProjectileR\nRogue Rebalancing\nSword Coast Stratagems \nSirine's Call\nSong and Silence\nThe Grey Clan\nTutu Sounds\nTutu Tweak Pack\nTutufix\nWidescreen Mod\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPlease rate and comment, I'd like to hear from you people :D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb9686aeeb6e29e27c5860c09fad78c8b533e15","amp;dn":"Baldurs+Gate+1+TUTU+%2B+all+fixes+and+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb9686aeeb6e29e27c5860c09fad78c8b533e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,185,104,106,238,182,226,158,39,197,134,12,9,250,215,140,139,83,62,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
