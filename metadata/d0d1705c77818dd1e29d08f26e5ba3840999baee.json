This torrent includes all of Muse's Origin of Symmetry Soundtrack, now WITHOUT VOICE!\n\nThat's right! No voice! Just the marvelous background music and instrumentals which decorate this epic Album.\nI have noticed that Pirate Bay has gotten hands on all of Muse's Soundtracks without Vocals but they do not have Origin of Symmetry, which I believe it to be one of the Best of Muse's Albums.\n\nWell, now that is finally fixed! Hurray!\n\nPlease go on and seed as much as you can, and spread the word! If this is successful, I'll compile and upload a torrent featuring ALL of Muse's Albums in instrumental.\n\n\nSpecial thanksto MuseInstrumentals @ Youtube for ripping and hosting this album originally.\n\nCheers!
