Shortly after this album was released, Turbo B had left the group and was replaced by Niki Harris, a former background singer for Madonna. \nThe album contains &quot;Rhythm Is a Dancer,&quot; a hit song that rocketed to number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Some of the other standout tracks on THE MADMAN'S RETURN are &quot;Don't Be Shy,&quot; &quot;Believe in It,&quot; &quot;Colour of Love,&quot; and &quot;Who Stole It?,&quot; the last of which has a sound that recalls one of the group's classics, &quot;The Power.&quot; (AMG)\n\n\nThis album by Snap! is my favourite dance album ever- yet it was shamefully overlooked! \nOne very big problem with this album is due to the fact that it was released in a confusing number of editions- I own the 3rd edition. \nThe first edition of this album doesn't contain the mega-hit &quot;Rhythm is a Dancer&quot;- rapper Turbo B said he didn't like the track and it didn't belong on the album. Snap! producers reluctantly complied and released his suggested first single &quot;Colour of Love&quot; and it was a flop! Snap! producers and Turbo B had major artistic differences- the producers decided to reissue the album with a new song &quot;Rhythm Is A Dancer&quot;, and it was the albums 2nd single release and was a major smash! \nSnap! parted ways with Turbo B after this and they reissed the LP for a third time, it also includes a new song and third single &quot;Exterminate&quot;, plus a 12&quot; version of &quot;Ryhthm is A Dancer&quot;. It really goes without saying that you should buy the 3rd Edition of &quot;Snap! The Madman's Return&quot; because you get three extra songs (2 songs that were hit singles). This special edition has the name &quot;Snap!&quot; written in gold not bright yellow lettering on the cover and in the top right hand corner it clearly states 3rd edition. Every track on this album is wonderful, it has truly unique dance sounds, the album is a timeless classic. \nThis album is just as good as, if not better than, their dedut LP &quot;World Power&quot;.
