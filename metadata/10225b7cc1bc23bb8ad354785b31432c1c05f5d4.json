Release notes ??????????????????????????????????????? ??? ? ?\n\n     The influence of Bristol, U.K.&amp;#039;s Massive crew on\n     bringing trippy beats to the foreground is\n     immeasurable. Not only were they the early test ground\n     for other alterna-hop stars (ex-clansman Tricky, former\n     songstresses Nicolette and Martina, and the lesser\n     known productionists Smith &amp; Mighty), they&amp;#039;ve spread\n     their influence to everyone from fellow Bristol\n     residents Portishead to BjÃƒÂ·rk. Blue Lines is Massive&amp;#039;s\n     debut record and is the second musical union of\n     Bristol&amp;#039;s renowned collective, Wildbunch. The emotional\n     purging and beat-driven orchestral movement of\n     &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; was among the first signs of life\n     in contemporary English trip-hop culture. Other\n     masterpieces, like &quot;Daydreaming,&quot; which features Shara\n     Nelson, Tricky, and other friends on the mic, throb\n     with deep, dubby beats and soulful ambiance. Blue Lines\n     marks the beginning of a musical legacy that is ever\n     expanding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10225b7cc1bc23bb8ad354785b31432c1c05f5d4","amp;dn":"Massive_Attack-Blue_Lines-1994-CBM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10225b7cc1bc23bb8ad354785b31432c1c05f5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,34,91,124,193,188,35,187,138,211,84,120,91,49,67,44,28,5,245,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
