Welcome to Radiant City.\n\nGary Burns joins forces with journalist Jim Brown to craft a vivid account of The Late Suburban Age.\n\nSprawl is eating the planet. Politicians call it growth. Developers call it business. The Moss family call it home.\n\nThe robotic realtor, Peggy Scott will hypnotize you into believing that there is nothing better than a &quot;Power Center&quot;. We warn you that the ignorance will be hard to watch. \n\nWhile Evan Moss zones out in commuter traffic, Ann boils over in her dream kitchen and the kids play sinister games amid the fresh foundations of monster houses.\n\nTurning the documentary genre inside out, Burns and Brown rummage through a toybox of cultural references from Jane Jacobs to The Sopranos to consider what happens when cities get sick and mutate.\n\nCinematographer Patrick McLaughlin evokes an eerie dystopian monoculture while the soundtrack features songs from Joey Santiago of The Pixies. Radiant City. Welcome to the neighborhood.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf678c1417a0cffc8347d0718869acf60edaec5b","amp;dn":"Radiant+City+-++A+Documentary+About+Urban+Sprawl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf678c1417a0cffc8347d0718869acf60edaec5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,103,140,20,23,160,207,252,131,71,208,113,136,105,172,246,14,218,236,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
