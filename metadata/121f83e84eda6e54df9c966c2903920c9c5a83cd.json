Originally released as a double album and later a single CD, it contains alternate versions and live recordings of many Feat tracks as well as some previously unreleased material.\n\n'New' tracks are as follows:\n\n&quot;Lonesome Whistle&quot; - the old Hank Williams track.\n&quot;Gringo&quot; - a Bill Payne track now frequently performed live by Little Feat since their 1988 reunion. This 1981 recording features David Sanborn on saxophone and Nicolette Larson on backing vocals.\n&quot;Over The Edge&quot; - a Paul Barrere track recorded in 1981 for a movie made by his brother\n&quot;Framed&quot; - an obscure Leiber and Stoller track, covered here by the original four-piece line-up of Little Feat\n&quot;China White&quot; - a Lowell George demo from the early 70s featuring among others Jim Keltner (drums) David Foster (piano) and guitar work by Fred Tackett (who would later join Little Feat when they reformed in 1988 ).\nThree of the live numbers (&quot;Skin It Back&quot;, &quot;Red Streamliner&quot; and &quot;Teenage Nervous Breakdown&quot;) were recorded in August 1977 at the Lisner Auditorium in Washington DC for the live Waiting For Columbus album. These were later included on the 2002 deluxe edition. The performance of &quot;Red Streamliner&quot; features Michael McDonald and Patrick Simmons of the Doobie Brothers on backing vocals. &quot;The Fan&quot; was recorded live at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead, New York on September 19, 1974.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Rocket In My Pocket&quot; (acoustic demo) (Lowell George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:51\n\n2.&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Doctor&quot; (alternate version) (George, Fred Martin ) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n\n3.&quot;Skin It Back&quot; (live from Lisner Auditorium) (Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n\n4.&quot;Easy To Slip&quot; (original Sailin' Shoes version) (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n\n5.&quot;Red Streamliner&quot; (live from Lisner Auditorium) (Bill Payne Fran Tate) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n\n6.&quot;Lonesome Whistle&quot; (Lowell George demo) (Hank Williams, Jimmie H.
