Its roots were in the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie's Big Band in the end of 40's.  The nucleus of the group was the duo John Lewis on piano and Milt Jackson on vibes.  With the bassist and drummer of the orchestra the group started to play as a quartet, in the beginning as Milt Jackson Quartet.  In 1952 the name was changed to Modern Jazz Quartet.  The arrangements of Lewis and his ideas about the style of performing began to influence more and more from the middle of the 50's.  Percy Heath was the bassplayer and Connie Kay replaced Kenny Clarke at drums in 1955.  These men played together until the end of 1974 when they disbanded for seven years. They rejoined in 1981 and played until the death of Kay in the end of 1994.  During 1992-4 Mickey Roker replaced occasionally Connie Kay, who was ill.  From 1995 Percy's brother Albert worked at the drums until 1997.  But their music lives!  MJQ has been very succesful also outside the normal jazz audience.\n\nThe roots of MJQ were in the rhytm section of Dizzy Gillespie's big band in 1946.  The rhytm section played occasionally for a while to give rest for the orchestra.  They liked to play together and they also recorded for Dizzy's label in 1948.  Soon the group developed to Milt Jackson Quartet of 1951-52.  Besides John Lewis and Milt Jackson the sets included Kenny Clarke or Al Jones on drums, Al Jackson or Ray Brown on bass and Chano Pozo on conga.  ~ Olavi Huuska\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Lewis - Piano\nMilt Jackson - Vibraphone\nPercy Heath - Bass\nMicky Roker - Drums\n\nModern Jazz Quartet - A Night At The Opera Tracks:\n01  Don't Stop This Train \n02  Blues In B \n03  Blues In A Mirror \n04  Blues In C Mirror \n05  Alexander's Fudge \n06  Mirror Love \n07  Legendary Profile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d78cfe3b197d64e5ba8c6632ad9f1f35a5c3c6","amp;dn":"Modern+Jazz+Quartet+-+A+Night+At+The+Opera+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d78cfe3b197d64e5ba8c6632ad9f1f35a5c3c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,215,140,254,59,25,125,100,229,186,140,102,50,173,159,31,53,165,195,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
