I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going &quot;Hey, did you hear the new blah blah...&quot; So, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out.  Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. \n\nBoy oh boy do I love this mix.  There has been so much good stuff over the past month.  May's mixtape definitely has a lot more indietronica in it, but there's definitely a handful of true folksy gems within.\n\nDo not miss out on the exclusive NewVillager tracks on this, they are what the Polarsets were to the April Mixtape.\n\n==============================================\nDID.YOU HEAR THE NEW MIXTAPE?
