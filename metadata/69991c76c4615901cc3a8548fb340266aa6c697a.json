The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Philippe Quinault's ThÃƒÂ©sÃƒÂ©e. It was Handel's third London opera, intended to follow the success of Rinaldo after the unpopular Il pastor fido.\n\nThe opera was premiered at the Queen's Theatre in London on 10 January 1713. It received an additional 12 performances through 16 May 1713. The singers included the castratos Valeriano Pellegrini and Valentino Urbani. Between 1713 and 1984, there were only two revivals, the first being the revival under Fritz Lehmann in GÃƒÂ¶ttingen on 29 June 1947. In 1985, the tercentenary of Handel's birth, the opera received three revivals. English Touring Opera produced Teseo in October and November 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69991c76c4615901cc3a8548fb340266aa6c697a","amp;dn":"Georg+Friedrich+Handel+-+Teseo+-+%5Bflac%5D+Opera+seria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69991c76c4615901cc3a8548fb340266aa6c697a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,153,28,118,196,97,89,1,204,58,133,72,251,52,2,102,170,108,105,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
