Wilson\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/tea-with-hezbollah-ted-dekker/1102340025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/tea-with-hezbollah-ted-dekker/1102340025&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOverview\nIs it really possible to love oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemies?\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the question that sparked a fascinating and, at times, terrifying journey into the heart of the Middle East during the summer of 2008. It was a trip that began in Egypt, passed beneath the steel and glass high rises of Saudi Arabia, then wound through the bullet- pocked alleyways of Beirut and dusty streets of Damascus, before ending at the cradle of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three major religions: Jerusalem.\n\nTea with Hezbollah combines nail-biting narrative with the texture of rich historical background, as readers join novelist Ted Dekker and his co-author and Middle East expert, Carl Medearis, on a hair-raising journey. They are with them in every rocky cab ride, late-night border crossing, and back-room conversation as they sit down one-on-one with some of the most notorious leaders of the Arab world. These candid discussions with leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, with muftis, sheikhs, and ayatollahs, with Osama bin LadenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brothers, reveal these men to be real people with emotions, fears, and hopes of their own. Along the way, Dekker and Medearis discover surprising answers and even more surprising questions that they could not have anticipatedÃ¢â‚¬â€questions that lead straight to the heart of Middle Eastern conflict.\n\nThrough powerful narrative Tea With Hezbollah will draw the West into a completely fresh understanding of those we call our enemies and the teaching that dares us to love them. A must read for all who see the looming threat rising in the Middle East.\n\nTed Dekker is the author of many nationally best-selling novels, including Bone ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daughters, The Circle Series, Thr3e, and House.
