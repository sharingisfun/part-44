His best-known songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \\\\\\&quot;Baby, What You Want Me to Do,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Bright Lights, Big City,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Honest I Do,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;You Don\\\\\\'t Have to Go,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Going to New York,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;Ain\\\\\\'t That Lovin\\\\\\' You Baby,\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Big Boss Man\\\\\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have become such an integral part of the standard blues repertoire, it\\\\\\'s almost as if they have existed forever. Because his style was simple and easily imitated, his songs were accessible to just about everyone from high-school garage bands having a go at it, to Elvis Presley, Charlie Rich, Lou Rawls, Hank Williams, Jr., and the Rolling Stones, making him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the long run ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ perhaps the most influential bluesman of all. His bottom-string boogie rhythm guitar patterns (all furnished by boyhood friend and longtime musical partner Eddie Taylor), simple two-string turnarounds, country-ish harmonica solos (all played in a neck-rack attachment hung around his neck), and mush-mouthed vocals were probably the first exposure most white folks had to the blues. And his music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lazy, loping, and insistent and constantly built and reconstructed single after single on the same sturdy frame ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a formula that proved to be enormously successful and influential, both with middle-aged blacks and young white audiences for a good dozen years. Jimmy Reed records hit the R&amp;B charts with amazing frequency and crossed over onto the pop charts on many occasions, a rare feat for an unreconstructed bluesman. This is all the more amazing simply because Reed\\\\\\'s music was nothing special on the surface; he possessed absolutely no technical expertise on either of his chosen instruments and his vocals certainly lacked the fierce declamatory intensity of a Howlin\\\\\\' Wolf or a Muddy Waters. But it was exactly that lack of in-your-face musical confrontation that made Jimmy Reed a welcome addition to everybody\\\\\\'s record collection back in the \\\\\\'50s and \\\\\\'60s. And for those aspiring musicians who wanted to give the blues a try, either vocally or instrumentally (no matter what skin color you were born with), perhaps Billy Vera said it best in his liner notes to a Reed greatest-hits anthology: \\\\\\&quot;Yes, anybody with a range of more than six notes could sing Jimmy\\\\\\'s tunes and play them the first day Mom and Dad brought home that first guitar from Sears &amp; Roebuck. I guess Jimmy could be termed the \\\\\\'50s punk bluesman.\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\nTracklist\n1 You\\\\\\'n That Sack \n2 I Told You Baby \n3 When You Left Me \n4 Please Don\\\\\\'t \n5 You\\\\\\'re Gonna Need My Help \n6 My Baby \n7 I  Ain\\\\\\'t Got You \n8 Come On Baby \n9 Shoot Me Baby \n10 Go Get My Baby \n11 Red Lights, the Stop Light \n12 I\\\\\\'m Gonna Love You\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6950413dad87782bf3770c265fe42135c5eb553b","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Reed++The+Blues+Is+My+Business+%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6950413dad87782bf3770c265fe42135c5eb553b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,80,65,61,173,135,120,43,243,119,12,38,95,228,33,53,197,235,85,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
