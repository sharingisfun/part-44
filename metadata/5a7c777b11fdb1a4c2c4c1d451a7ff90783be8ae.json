Topics discussed include the birth of the superlattice; resonant tunneling via man-made quantum well states; optical properties and Raman scattering in man-made quantum systems; dielectric function and doping of a superlattice; and quantum step and activation energy. The book also covers semiconductor atomic superlattice; Si quantum dots fabricated from annealing amorphous silicon; capacitance, dielectric constant, and doping quantum dots; porous silicon; and quantum impedance of electrons.\r\n\r\nWritten by one of the founders of this field\r\nDelivers over 20% new material, including new research and new technological applications\r\nProvides a basic understanding of the physics involved from first principles, while adding new depth, using basic mathematics and an explanation of the background essentials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a7c777b11fdb1a4c2c4c1d451a7ff90783be8ae","amp;dn":"Superlattice+to+Nanoelectronics+2nd+ed+-+Raphael+Tsu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a7c777b11fdb1a4c2c4c1d451a7ff90783be8ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,124,119,123,17,253,177,164,194,196,193,212,81,167,255,144,120,59,232,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
