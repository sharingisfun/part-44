With their initial records, the group crossed the bridge between punk/new wave and Top 40 pop more than any other band, recording a series of hard, spiky singles that were also melodic and immediately accessible. Hynde was an invigorating, sexy singer who bent the traditional male roles of rock &amp; roll to her own liking, while guitarist James Honeyman-Scott created a sonic palette filled with suspended chords, effects pedals, and syncopated rhythms that proved remarkably influential over the next two decades. After Honeyman-Scott's death, the Pretenders became a more straightforward rock band, yet Hynde's semi-autobiographical songwriting and bracing determination meant that the group never became just another rock band, even when their music became smoother and more pop-oriented. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t96.80% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner\nCatalog:\t\t8573-84607-2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Brass In Pocket\n02.Message Of Love\n03.Don't Get Me Wrong\n04.Kid\n05.Human\n06.I Go To Sleep\n07.Forever Young\n08.I Got You Babe (UB40 &amp; Chrissie Hynde)\n09.Night In My Veins\n10.Spiritual High (State Of Independence)\n11.Talk Of The Town\n12.Stop Your Sobbing\n13.Hymn To Her\n14.2000 Miles\n15.Breakfast In Bed (UB40 &amp; Chrissie Hynde)\n16.Popstar\n17.Middle Of The Road\n18.Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n19.Back On The Chain Gang\n20.I'll Stand By You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e73e208c059d4e681cf7d337a1d8c6f2e5d39929","amp;dn":"The+Pretenders+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29++%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e73e208c059d4e681cf7d337a1d8c6f2e5d39929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,62,32,140,5,157,78,104,28,247,211,55,161,216,198,242,229,211,153,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
