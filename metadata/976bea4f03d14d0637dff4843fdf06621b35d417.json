Follow the evolution of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;blaxploitation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; action cinema with this funk-filled documentary that features clips from such seminal genre faves as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Sweet Sweetback\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Baadasssss Song,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Shaft,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Superfly,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Coffy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;; discussions with Pam Grier, Melvin Van Peebles, Richard Roundtree, Fred Williamson, Quentin Tarantino and others; and much more. 56 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English Dolby Digital stereo; extended interviews. \n\nPlot----------------------------\n\nWith archive film clips and interviews, this brief look at a frequently overlooked historical period of filmmaking acts as an introduction rather than a complete record. Features interviews with some of the genre\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s biggest stars, like Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, and Richard Roundtree. Director Melvin Van Peebles discusses the historical importance of his landmark film Sweet Sweetback\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Baadasssss Song. For a contemporary perspective, the excitable Quentin Tarantino offers his spirited commentary and author/critic bell hooks provides some scholarly social analysis.\n\nThe music of Blaxploitation films is rightfully discussed, focusing on Curtis Mayfield\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Superfly and Isaac Hayes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; Shaft. Also features interviews with writer/director Larry Cohen and film historian Armond White. BaadAsssss Cinema was originally shown on the Independent Film Channel in August 2002 as part of a week-long Blaxploitation film festival.\n\n[edit] Contributors\n\n    * Larry Cohen\n    * Ron Finley\n    * Pam Grier\n    * Ed Guerrero\n    * Gloria Hendry\n    * bell hooks\n    * Samuel L.
