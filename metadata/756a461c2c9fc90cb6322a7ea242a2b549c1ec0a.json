Figura, Arthur A.Teixeira (Springer, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-540-34191-8\r\n\r\nFood Physics deals with the physical properties of food, food ingredients and their measurement. Physical properties of food play a key role in all fields where modern technological processes are applied for the generation of food raw materials and the production of food. The determination of physical properties of food and related products are a pre-requisite for planning, production engineering and automation processes in todayâ€™s food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries as well as in all related quality control activities.\r\n\r\nThis book describes the principles of food physics starting with the very basics and focuses on the needs of practitioners without omitting important basic principles. It will be indispensable for future students of food technology and food chemistry as well as for engineers, technologists and technicians in the food industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:756a461c2c9fc90cb6322a7ea242a2b549c1ec0a","amp;dn":"Food+Physics+-+Physical+Properties%2C+Measurement+and+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"756a461c2c9fc90cb6322a7ea242a2b549c1ec0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,106,70,28,44,159,201,12,182,50,42,126,162,66,162,181,73,193,236,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
