Fired up by the gesture of confidence, Americans banded together to wholeheartedly support the motion, leading to tips that helped facilitate the capture of the advertised criminals. Some of those on the list even surrendered voluntarily due to the increased publicity. The roguesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gallery showcases fugitives such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ William Raymond Nesbit, first on the list to be captured\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ James Earl Ray, assassin of Martin Luther King Jr.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ted Bundy, ruthless serial killer\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ruth Eisemann-Schier, kidnapper and first woman to make the Top Ten\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, 1993 World Trade Center bomber\nThis encyclopedia includes criminalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ photographs, crime details, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“interesting fugitive factsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as a brief history of the list and what it has accomplished in more than fifty years.\n\n\n\nBy Duane Swierczynski\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 340 pages, English (1628739061\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c57a0d40481cb6796c526e8f855cdf78ceb41a4","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+the+FBI%27s+Ten+Most+Wanted+List%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c57a0d40481cb6796c526e8f855cdf78ceb41a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,87,160,212,4,129,203,103,150,197,38,232,248,85,205,247,140,235,65,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
