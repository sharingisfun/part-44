The new name, &quot;DumDum Boys&quot;, was taken from a song on the album &quot;The Idiot&quot; by Iggy Pop. Their debut album, Blodig Alvor (na na na na na) is still regarded as one of the classic albums in Norwegian rock. The same is true for their 1989 album, Splitter Pine.\nAlso go under the name Racer BK when releasing songs that are &quot;not so serious&quot;, for example, &quot;BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸nda i fra Nord&quot; (&quot;Farmers From The North&quot;), the official song for the Norwegian National Soccer Team for the European Championships in 2000.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d1d60f29058ee4d966785d77fad8da52927f98","amp;dn":"DumDum+Boys+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40d1d60f29058ee4d966785d77fad8da52927f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,209,214,15,41,5,142,228,217,102,120,93,119,250,216,218,82,146,127,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
