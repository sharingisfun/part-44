Having given up their comfortable lives, they are faced with the dangers and many hardships of war. The families experience all aspects of life as it was in 1944. The men work long, punishing days down the coal mine, followed by tending the Stack Square shared allotment as people were encouraged to 'Dig for Victory' to overcome food shortages. They also have to endure the arduous Home Guard training, each getting a taste of army life and discipline. The women have to juggle their relentless household chores with compulsory work at the munitions factory, undertaking a variety of different tasks for the war effort. The children, meanwhile, have their own worries with daily doses of cod liver oil and the ever present threat that their pet rabbits may be served up for dinner. Joined by evacuees and the Bevin Boys, young lads sent by the Government to work the mines, the families struggle to cope with strict regimes, rationing, air raids and blackout fines but rediscover the strong community spirit and courage that war evoked.\n\n\n1)  Part 1\nCoal House is back and this time its war. Deep in the Welsh valleys, three families give up their 21st century creature comforts and time travel back to 1944 to face the hardships of life in World War II. Will the community survive without a microwave, mobile, fast car or fast food?\n\n2)  Part 2\nThe families settle into the punishing routine of 1944. The men face a tough training period to equip them for life at the coal face and in the Home Guard. The children cope with school and discipline, and the women face the dangers of the munitions factory as well as running the home.\n\n3)  Part 3\nThree Welsh families give up their 21st century creature comforts and time travel back to 1944 to face the hardships of life in World War II. It's not just the coal-mining men who are finding it hard to reach their targets. The women are struggling to impress at the factory and the children find it tough to keep the school standards.\n\n4)  Part 4\nAt the end of the first week in the Coal House, how are the children coping with no playstations or mobiles to occupy them? There's a strict school system to contend with and a daily dose of cod liver oil to swallow. Will they pass the school cleanliness inspection, and how will they get on with the animals at Stack Square?\n\n5)  Part 5 \nThe weekend provides a break from the pressures of work. While the men head off for football training, the women get their hair done Forties-style. Back at the Coal House there are new arrivals\n\n6)  Part 6 \nThe women take on a secret mission at the munitions factory, while the men struggle down the mine. Just as it seems things are looking up with a variety show, the families are brought face to face with the grim realities of war.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nThe new arrivals are settling in as the second week in the Coal House draws to a close. Home sickness is rife, school exams are looming, and the Bevin Boys are learning to cook. But who will give the best performance in the variety show?\n\n8)  Part 8 \nTensions are running high, the women reach a munitions milestone and there's panic underground. The Bevin Boys take their first tentative steps underground and what little confidence they have soon begins to dwindle as the reality of the task ahead starts to dawn on them. The pressure is on to succeed, but their inexperience leads to some choice words from the other Stack Square men.\n\n9)  Part 9 \nIt's been a rollercoaster week for the Coal House families. The families let their hair down and party like it's 1944, some of the Stack Square chickens end up on the menu and there's evacuation drama for the families.\n\n10)  Part 10 \nWith victory nearing, the pressure is on to fuel the frontline in the mining community of the Coal House. Will the men in the mine and the women at the munitions factory hit their deadlines? The scholarship exam looms at school, and a testing day in the mud leads to promotion for one of the Home Guard\n\n11)  Part 11 \nIt is time for the men to hang up their lamps, the women to take off their uniforms, and the evacuees to return to their parents in the city - but not before everyone gets in the swing at the community dance for a final send-off.\n\n12)  Part 12 \nThe children take the dreaded school exams as they spend their last week in the square. Who will receive the coveted trophy, and how will they feel about leaving their wartime lives behind?\n\n13)  Dance House 1944 \nDance House 1944 takes a look at how people faced the music and danced during the Second World War despite bombs falling and bad news from abroad. Veterans of the fighting front and the home front describe how important dancing was for them and chart the changes in fashion from strictly ballroom to jitterbug and jive.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/6095/coalhouseatwarscreen0.jpg&quot;
