Blue is the last refuge of the civilized world, Yellow is war-torn and ridden with disease, and the Red Zone is nothing but a wasteland. Live-action video clips combine seamlessly with more than 30 single-player missions for a sweeping story. The power of technology is displayed as you blow chunks off enemy tanks with your rockets. Fog of war takes on new meaning as smoke, fire, haze, tracers, explosions, and state-of-the-art weather effects all contaminate the battlefield. Combine units to create super-units and wipe your enemies off the face of the planet!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6644c13ae50a5336b2b0f680f948631a7276fecb","amp;dn":"Command+%26amp%3B+Conquer+3+Tiberium+Wars+NTSC%2FU+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6644c13ae50a5336b2b0f680f948631a7276fecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,68,193,58,229,10,83,54,178,176,246,128,249,72,99,26,114,118,254,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
