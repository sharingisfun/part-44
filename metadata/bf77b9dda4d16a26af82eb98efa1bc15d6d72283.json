Break\n\nAphrodite's Child was a Greek progressive rock band formed in 1967, by Vangelis (keyboards), Demis Roussos (bass guitar and vocals), Loukas Sideras (drums and vocals), and Anargyros &quot;Silver&quot; Koulouris (guitar). Their band's name was derived from the title of a track from another Mercury act, Dick Campbell, from his Sings Where It's At album. Papathanassiou and Roussos had already been successful in Greece (playing in the bands Formynx and Idols respectively) while they got together with Sideras and Koulouris to form a new band. Their first recording as a band was for George Romanos' album In Concert and in Studio where they played on four songs and were credited as 'Vangelis and his Orchestra'. In the same year they recorded a two song demo and submitted it to Philips Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf77b9dda4d16a26af82eb98efa1bc15d6d72283","amp;dn":"Aphrodite%27s+Child+discography+3+albums+2CDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf77b9dda4d16a26af82eb98efa1bc15d6d72283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,119,185,221,164,209,106,38,175,130,235,152,239,161,188,21,214,215,34,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
