He remains one of the genre's most\nrecognized artists. His lean and powerful style exemplified the\nStax Sound, and gave Stax a new identity; he was said to be its\n&quot;heart and soul&quot; while artists such as Al Jackson, Dunn and Cropper\nhelped to expand its structure. His open-throated singing, the\ntremolo/vibrato, the manic, electrifying stage performances and\nperceived honesty were particular hallmarks, along with the use of\ninterjections, for example &quot;gotta, gotta, gotta&quot;, some of which\ncame from Cooke. Producer Stewart thought the &quot;begging singing&quot;\nwas stress-induced and enhanced by Redding's extreme, early shyness\n\n\n\n\n\nPain in My Heart 1964\n\n1.
