Her first order of business is to close down her mother's restaurant, but childhood friend Sung Chan (Jin Gu) puts a dent in her plans. A cooking prodigy who now makes a living selling vegetables, Sung Chan owes much to Jang Eun's family, and he's not about to sit back and let Jang Eun's resentment destroy the restaurant. The two decide to settle their score at the national kimchi competition, using the same recipe from their childhood. The follow-up to the 2007 blockbuster Le Grand Chef based on Hur Young Man's comic, Le Grand Chef: Kimchi Battle features a new director and cast, but the same surefire recipe for a scrumptious hit. This time the cuisine at stake is none other than kimchi, pickled side dishes that complete every Korean meal. Answering the battle cry for kimchi are popular actress Kim Jung Eun (Forever the Moment) and Jin Gu, fresh off his award-winning performance in Mother, who play chefs competing to find the true taste of kimchi. Director Baek Dong Hun and screenwriter Shin Dong Ik, who co-wrote the first Le Grand Chef, cook up a delicious entree that's as mouthwatering and heartwarming as the first film. \n\ntrailer : utube, Le Grand Chef - Kimchi War (2010) Korean Movie Trailer \n\naudio : Korean DD5.1\n\nSub : English, Chinese\n\nR3 retail\n\nNTSC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3da3a529175587e3db63791ed8314364526f8ee2","amp;dn":"Le+Grand+Chef+-+Kimchi+Battle+DVDr-sailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3da3a529175587e3db63791ed8314364526f8ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,163,165,41,23,85,135,227,219,99,121,30,216,49,67,100,82,111,142,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
