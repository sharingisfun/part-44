If so, then you're undoubtedly one of the more obsessive Beach Boys fans out there, and Hawthorne, CA was produced with you -- and only a scant few others -- in mind. More akin to an audio scrapbook or musical documentary than a true rarities compilation, this two-disc set is packed with over two exhausting hours of session excerpts, alternate versions, backing tracks (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Stack-O-Tracks), and a handful of stereo remixes. It's also interspersed with dialogue from bandmembers, a process that only enhances the already fragmentary nature of a collection like this. The only genuinely new songs are &quot;Lonely Days,&quot; an artifact from the Wild Honey era, and Dennis Wilson's &quot;A Time to Live in Dreams&quot; from 1968. Still, almost every track has never been released previously, and fans of the band's lost masterpiece Smile will find several tracks of intriguing material, including revealing stereo versions of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; and &quot;Vegetables.&quot; Also included is a considerable excerpt from the original tapes of the Beach Boys' first garage session (for the &quot;Surfin'&quot; single), complete with Dennis' wacky mic testing and threats from various bandmates that they'll get popped in the nose if they laugh during another take. Hawthorne, CA proves two things over and over again -- with every a cappella mix, it proves the Beach Boys were one of the most amazing harmonists of the rock era, and with several of the newly stereo versions, listeners can hear what a good stereo remix can do to even the most lackluster songs, like 1970s &quot;Cotton Fields (The Cotton Song)&quot; -- itself a misguided attempt to duplicate the success of 1966's &quot;Sloop John B.&quot; A bounty of intriguing songs for the collector and true-believer fan, but far from necessary for disinterested listeners.\n\nCD1:\n1\t\tMike Love Introduces Surfin'\tLove\t0:48\n2\t\tThe Surfin' Rehearsal\tLove, Wilson\t2:40\n3\t\tHappy Birthday Four Freshmen\t\t0:56\n4\t\tMike on Brian's Harmonies\tLove\t0:45\n5\t\tTheir Hearts Were Full of Spring\tTroup\t2:31\n6\t\tSurfin' U.S.A.\tBerry\t2:03\n7\t\tSurfin' U.S.A.\tBerry\t2:35\n8\t\tCarl Wilson Radio Promo\t\t0:15\n9\t\tShut Down\tChristian, Wilson\t1:56\n10\t\tLittle Deuce Coupe\tChristian, Wilson\t1:51\n11\t\tMurry Wilson Directs a RadioPromo\t\t0:25\n12\t\tFun, Fun, Fun\tLove, Wilson\t2:26\n13\t\tBrian's Message to &quot;Rog&quot; - Take 22\t\t0:29\n14\t\tDance, Dance, Dance [Stereo Mix]\tWilson, Wilson\t2:05\n15\t\tKiss Me, Baby [A Cappella Mix]\tLove, Wilson\t2:49\n16\t\tGood to My Baby\tWilson\t2:32\n17\t\tChuck Britz on Brian in the Studio\t\t0:21\n18\t\tSalt Lake City [Session Highlights]\tWilson\t1:49\n19\t\tSalt Lake City [Stereo Mix]\tWilson\t2:08\n20\t\tWish That He Could Stay [Session Excerpt]Love, Wilson\t1:12\n21\t\tAnd Your Dream Comes True [Stereo Remix]\tLove, Wilson\t1:06\n22\t\tCarol K Session Highlights\t\t2:12\n23\t\tThe Little Girl I Once Knew [Alternate Version]\tWilson\t2:33\n24\t\tAlan and Dennis Introduce Barbara Ann\t\t0:29\n25\t\tBarbara Ann [Session Excerpt]\tFassert\t2:52\n26\t\tBarbara Ann [Master Take Without Party Overdubs]\tFassert\t3:08\n27\t\tMike on the Everly Brothers\tLove\t0:22\n28\t\tDevoted to You [Master Take Without Party Overdubs]\tBryant\t2:19\n29\t\tIn the Back of My Mind [Dennis Thanks Everybody Intro]\tWilson\t2:25\n\nCD2:\n1\t\tCan't Wait Too Long [A Cappella Mix]\tWilson\t0:51\n2\t\tDennis Introduces Carl\t\t0:43\n3\t\tGood Vibrations [Stereo Track Session]\tLove, Wilson\t3:13\n4\t\tGood Vibrations [Concert Rehearsal]\tLove, Wilson\t4:09\n5\t\tHeroes and Villains [Stereo Single Version]\tParks, Wilson\t3:40\n6\t\tVegetables\tParks, Wilson\t0:56\n7\t\tVegetables [Stereo Extended Mix]\tParks, Wilson\t3:01\n8\t\tWith Me Tonight\tWilson\t0:49\n9\t\tLonely Days\t\t0:52\n10\t\tBruce on Wild Honey\t\t0:14\n11\t\tLet the Wind Blow [Stereo Remix]\tLove, Wilson\t2:35\n12\t\tI Went to Sleep [A Cappella Mix]\tWilson, Wilson\t1:35\n13\t\tTime to Get Alone [Alternate Version]\tWilson\t3:39\n14\t\tAlan and Brian Talk About Dennis\t\t0:19\n15\t\tA Time to Live in Dreams\tKalinich, Wilson\t1:50\n16\t\tBe With Me\tWilson\t3:17\n17\t\tDennis Introduces Cotton Fields\t\t0:10\n18\t\tCotton Fields (The Cotton Song) [Stereo Single Version]\tLeadbelly 3:15\n19\t\tAlan and Carl on Break Away\t\t0:21\n20\t\tBreak Away [Alternate Version]\tDunbar, Wilson\t3:12\n21\t\tAdd Some Music to Your Day [A Cappella Mix]\tKnott, Love, Wilson\t3:29\n22\t\tDennis Wilson\t\t0:27\n23\t\tForever [A Cappella Mix]\tJakobson, Wilson\t2:51\n24\t\tSail on Sailor\tAlmer, Kennedy, Parks, Rieley, Wilson\t3:16\n25\t\tOl' Man River [Vocal Section]\tHammerstein, Kern\t1:20\n26\t\tCarl Wilson\t\t0:39\n27\t\tThe Lord's Prayer [Stereo Remix]\tMalotte\t2:33\n28\t\tCarl Wilson - Coda\t\t2:28\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hawthorne-ca-r532370&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hawthorne-ca-r532370&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a12e32d7c40701c364b500e2b0f2464c2f1f8f","amp;dn":"Beach.Boys.-.Hawthorne.CA.FLAC.2CD-Mighty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33a12e32d7c40701c364b500e2b0f2464c2f1f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,161,46,50,215,196,7,1,195,100,181,0,226,176,242,70,76,47,31,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
