Despite this surge in attention, the British producerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music remains how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been, with a firm focus on beat driven house music that touches on elements\nof Garage, UK Garage and beyond.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœNo Matter WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sees Huxley delve deep with a robust yet light in tone house cut riddled with playful melodies and a hooky vocal refrain that is gently teased throughout. Heady and punchy at the same time, Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo Matter WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is followed with a similarly impressive cut in Ã¢â‚¬ËœCanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t SleepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Centred around warm yet dominating chords that leap from the earthy beats/bass bedding, Ã¢â‚¬ËœCanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t SleepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is yet another Huxley bomb.\n\nMK delivers two mixes of Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo Matter WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with his Ã¢â‚¬ËœmixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ version proving infectious from the off with some nimble vocal edits and FM bass licks unravelling towards powerful mid-section drop that switches the bottom end rhythms up nicely.\nThe MK Dub is last but by no means least, with the veteran producer chopping the vocals up even more and pairing them with light key stabs and wandering bass notes in his much-copied but never-bettered style. Here the drops are limited to nagging vocal edits, serving only to emphasis the kicks even more.\n\nTsuba never misses the mark and this 12Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another winner, and one that sees two producers in their element.\n\nFull Prerelease EP - www.techconnet.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac902ca8c31c3984b124504eea14c8e0460d1e86","amp;dn":"Huxley+-+No+Matter+What+%5BTsuba%5D+%5BTSUBA063%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac902ca8c31c3984b124504eea14c8e0460d1e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,144,44,168,195,28,57,132,177,36,80,78,234,20,200,224,70,13,30,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
