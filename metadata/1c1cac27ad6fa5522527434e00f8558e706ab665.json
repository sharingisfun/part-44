Orphans Of Dusk, a band hailing from New Zealand and Australia, deliver enormous, powerful goth-doom riffs that are infused with both delight and derision. This is Type O Negative revisited, with a bit of rampaging death metal thrown in to add an energetic edginess to the gothic drama. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an interesting twist that raises this four-track EP from mere homage to something altogether more appealing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reminiscent of Rise Of AvernusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning Ã¢â‚¬ËœLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appel Du VideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ but without the female delicacy.\n\n\nTrack list:\n1. August Price 05:03\n2. Starless 07:25\n3. Nibelheim 06:36\n4.
