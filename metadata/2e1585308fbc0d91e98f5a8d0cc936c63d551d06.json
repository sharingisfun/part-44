Removed a second of white picture in act II where a scene is made out of two cuts. This makes a music stutter because the music is edited over this pause.\n\nThis was just for fun. Renegrade will hopefully release a re-mastered dvd quality version.\n\nDescription:\n\n Striving to go where no internet film has gone before, Star Trek: Of Gods and Men, is an all-new three-part mini-series featuring many Trek alumni, with a cast that spans all 5 Star Trek TV series, as well as eight of the Star Trek feature films. The ultimate salute celebrating Star Trek 40-plus years, Star Trek: Of Gods and Men will be released on the Internet, with each webisode approximately 30 minutes in length.\n\nStar Trek: Of Gods and Men stars Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols (Uhura and Chekov of the original series) and Alan Ruck (Captain John Harriman of the 7th Trek feature film, Star Trek Generations) along with Grace Lee Whitney (Janice Rand of the original series).
