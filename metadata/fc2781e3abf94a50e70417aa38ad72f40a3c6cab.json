Platerspiel (Live) 10:20\n\n\nA best-of collection from one of Europe's most popular medieval bands. 13 tracks from 1993 to the 2003. Period pieces with a plethora of pipes, plenty of percussion, and an abundane of attitude.\nImagine bagpipes and percussion performed by a group of eight men who look, if the cover photo is any indication, like the outest of outlaws -- in this version, an outrageous blend of leather drag, half masks, monks' robes and period instruments. (I gather that this is more or less normal -- some sources refer to the musicians performing &quot;half-naked, dressed in unusual clothes, wearing different ancient decorations, and often tattooed.&quot; Sounds like my kind of people.) The music is totally captivating. Largely instrumental, the sources are medieval but branch out into world-beat and contemporary rock, and probably a few other places I haven't figured out yet.\n\nThe band is known for its authentic source material and carefully researched and constructed period instruments. The sound is unique. The band is presently composed of five bagpipe players and three percussionists who together produce something that immediately brings to mind a medieval fair. More contemporary rhythms are subtly introduced and quite effective.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc2781e3abf94a50e70417aa38ad72f40a3c6cab","amp;dn":"Corvus+Corax+-+2003+-+Best+of+Corvus+Corax+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc2781e3abf94a50e70417aa38ad72f40a3c6cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,39,129,227,171,249,74,80,231,4,23,170,56,173,114,244,10,60,108,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
