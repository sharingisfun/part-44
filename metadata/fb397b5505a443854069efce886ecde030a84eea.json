The show was based in the Watts section of Los Angeles where the mom was the single parent with two children in the household. The show itself was side-splitting hilarious indeed catching the gang down at the soda stop coming up with some crazy scheme or another, and catching Rerun and Shirley (the waitress) battling it out, or getting some girl to go out with them. The show was a major top ten hit for the ABC network. Worth watching though. Classic. \n\nScreenshots - \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb397b5505a443854069efce886ecde030a84eea","amp;dn":"What%27s+Happening%21%21+Season+1+%28fiveofseven%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb397b5505a443854069efce886ecde030a84eea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,57,123,85,5,164,67,133,64,105,239,206,136,110,205,224,48,168,78,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
