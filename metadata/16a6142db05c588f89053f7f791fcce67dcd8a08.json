She is a fallen angel, banished from Heaven by God after being tricked into questioning His love for humans. Avengelyne was stripped of all her angelic abilities, other than her great strength and her blood, which has magical properties.\n\nCo-created by Rob Liefeld and Cathy Christian, and originally published by Maximum Press, she had a stint at Awesome Entertainment (one issue published only) and enjoyed a short stint at Avatar Press. It was recently announced that Avengelyne would be returning to comics in the Arcana Studio oneshot Avengelyne vs. Koni Waves due for a 2009 release.\n\nAvatar Press version of Avengelyne commonly considered in different continuity.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a6142db05c588f89053f7f791fcce67dcd8a08","amp;dn":"Avengelyne+%28Maximum+%2B+Avatar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a6142db05c588f89053f7f791fcce67dcd8a08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,166,20,45,176,92,88,143,137,5,63,127,121,31,204,230,125,205,138,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
