His job? Nothing too violent, just disposing of bodies, doing a little cleanup if necessary. But in Brett Battles\\' electrifying debut novel, Quinn\\'s latest assignment will change everything, igniting a harrowing journey of violence, betrayal, and revenge.\n\nThe job seemed simple enough: investigating a suspicious case of arson. But when a dead body turns up where it doesn\\'t belongÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥and Quinn\\'s handlers at \\&quot;the Office\\&quot; turn strangely silentÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥he knows he\\'s in over his head.\n\nThe Cleaner\nUK\nWith only a handful of clues, Quinn scrambles for cover, struggling to find out why someone wants him dead . . . and if it\\'s linked to a larger attempt to wipe out the Office.\n\nHis only hope may be Orlando, a woman from his past who\\'s reluctant to help but who may hold the key to solving the case. Suddenly the two are prying into old crimes, crisscrossing continents, struggling to stay alive long enough to unbury the truth. But as the hunt intensifies, Quinn is stunned by what he uncovers: a chilling secret . . . and a brilliantly orchestrated conspiracyÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥with an almost unimaginable goal.\n\nFuriously paced, filled with superbly drawn characters and pitch-perfect dialogue, The Cleaner puts a powerful twist on all our expectations as it confirms Brett Battles\\' place as one of the most exciting new talents in suspense fiction today.\n\n---------------------\n\nI couldn\\'t find a pdf of this great book anywhere, so once I finally found a txt doc while trolling I felt I should upload for your reading pleasure :)\n\nMake sure to check out the following two installments in the Jonathan Quinn series: The Deceived and Shadow of Betrayal. The fourth installment entitled The Silenced will be released on April 5, 2011.\n\nIf you enjoy Brett Battles\\' novels, please purchase them. I personally own all three installments and will be picking the fourth up the day it hits shelves. For convenience sake though, it is nice to have a pdf you can read on your phone or e-reader :D\t\t\n\n---------------------\n\nRe-uploaded with better format. Same file but now the words aren't broken; it is much easier to read now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4135bfbb7395aa7dc8a8b27545f0bd08f22379","amp;dn":"The+Cleaner+Brett+Battles+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4135bfbb7395aa7dc8a8b27545f0bd08f22379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,65,53,191,187,115,149,170,125,200,168,178,117,69,240,189,8,242,35,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
