The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16595f33007373b97fcb3f68a26a1173a6dd75aa","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+Connect+-+Blue+-+8.200+-+English+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16595f33007373b97fcb3f68a26a1173a6dd75aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,89,95,51,0,115,115,185,127,203,63,104,162,106,17,115,166,221,117,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
