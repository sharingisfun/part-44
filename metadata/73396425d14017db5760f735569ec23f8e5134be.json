Sherwood contributed saxophone and tambourine performances to the album, and Zappa wrote one of the album's songs, &quot;If I Could Only Be Your Love Again,&quot; and played guitar on another track from the album, &quot;Dedicated to the One I Love.&quot;[1] During the band's 1973 tour, Ruben and the Jets were booked alongside Three Dog Night and West, Bruce and Laing, and played alongside Tower of Power, Azteca, and Cheech &amp; Chong. Ruben and the Jets released a second album, Con Safos, before disbanding in the mid-1970s.[1] The band is referenced during the final scene of Up in Smoke, in which Cheech Marin's character, Pedro De Pacas commented that Alice Bowie, the band that he and Tommy Chong's Anthony &quot;Man&quot; Stoner character led in the film, will be &quot;bigger than Ruben and the Jets.&quot; Guevara appeared in the film as Tom, a trumpet player for the band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73396425d14017db5760f735569ec23f8e5134be","amp;dn":"Ruben+and+the+Jets+-+For+Real","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73396425d14017db5760f735569ec23f8e5134be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,57,100,37,209,64,23,219,87,96,247,53,86,158,194,63,142,81,52,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
