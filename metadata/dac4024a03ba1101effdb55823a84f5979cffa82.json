Owners Jay and Uttam have endured an agonising six-month search for a new head chef to help take their first steps towards opening a small chain of restaurants. They've now turned to Alex for help to find the right person.\n\nThe first three candidates are put through a gruelling hands-on interview process. In the first skill test, who can identify the fish and then make the right choice for starters? Will Skye's bohemian style be just what the restaurant is looking for, and will Saurabh's fine dining technique be inspired or a touch too much?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Jun-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac4024a03ba1101effdb55823a84f5979cffa82","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E13.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dac4024a03ba1101effdb55823a84f5979cffa82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,196,2,74,3,186,17,1,239,253,181,88,35,168,79,89,121,207,250,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
