You probably could put together a slightly more magnetic cycle from BernsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two, but if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for one box with practically no weaknesses, this is it. To recapitulate briefly: only two of these performances previously enjoyed wide currencyÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe Seventh, which is one of the great ones, and the Fourth, which is good but not great (it is, in fact, the weakest performance in the set). Everything else is wonderful, the two new performances (the Fifth and the Ninth) especially so. Gielen turns in a performance of the Fifth very similar (surprisingly) to KubelikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Without stinting on the emotional intensity of the first two movements, he keeps the music moving swiftly with no sentimental lingering at all. The scherzo swings merrily along, the Adagietto adopts a flowing tempo in keeping with current thought as to how it should be played, and the finale goes as if self-propelled.\nThe Ninth is even finer: a first movement of exceptional organic unity with impressive climaxes and exceptionally clear polyphonic lines; a second movement that generously observes MahlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempo indication to speed up the crazy waltz each time it returns (there is no finer version available); an aptly nasty Rondo: Burleske that puts on a striking burst of speed toward the finish; and a finale that flows purposefully forward before evaporating in the most ethereal of codas. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been collecting the other symphonies, you already know that Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 rank with the very best available. They are all beautifully recorded and are played with uninhibited virtuosity by the SWR orchestra. Spread over 13 discs, and absent the often strange and silly (but equally well done) couplings by various contemporary composers, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the most economically laid out set: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the best. Nothing more need be said. \nfrom http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-10541/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79eda28c07eee60ae20a93341bf79c650aad46bc","amp;dn":"Mahler+Symphonies+1-9%2C+Adagio%2C+Michael+Gielen+SWR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79eda28c07eee60ae20a93341bf79c650aad46bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,237,162,140,7,238,230,10,226,10,147,52,27,247,156,101,10,173,70,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
