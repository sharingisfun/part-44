Her mother, Hyo-jeong smuggles drugs from a drug trafficking organization and entrusts Tae-shik with the product, without letting him know. The traffickers find out about her smuggling and kidnap both Hyo-jeong and So-mi. The gang promises to release them if Tae-shik makes a delivery for them, however it actually is a larger plot to eliminate a rival drug ring leader. When Hyo-jeon's disemboweled body is discovered, Tae-shik realizes that So-mi's life may also be in danger. Tae-shik becomes enraged at the prospect that So-mi may already be dead and prepares for a battle, putting his own life at risk.\n\nDirector:\nJeong-beom Lee\nWriter:\nJeong-beom Lee\nStars:\nBin Won, Sae-ron Kim, Tae-hoon Kim \n\nFrom South Korea in Korean\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1226cbf3489a52d11841ec0032a12e25e261af30","amp;dn":"The+Man+from+Nowhere+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1226cbf3489a52d11841ec0032a12e25e261af30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,38,203,243,72,154,82,209,24,65,236,0,50,161,46,37,226,97,175,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
