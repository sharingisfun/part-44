Sheesh.\n\nCherokee folk singer Don Grooms made his name as a songwriter and humorist on the Florida folk circuit. I had the privilege of meeting him, hearing him play, buying his tape, and pirating his legacy. I wish I had more to share. \n\n&quot;Cuz this is my song and I'll sing it like I want to\nIf you like my music sing along with me.\nBut don't try to change a part\nOf the songbird in my heart\nAnd don't try and tell me that the song is wrong\nYou can always change the singer\nYou can't change my song.\n\nYou can always get another singer\nBut you'll just get another song.&quot;\n\n    -Don Grooms, 1930-1998 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e6ceac254901c3a6bc9231d7e0b3caa41dffb7","amp;dn":"Don+Grooms+-+Pure+Trash","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e6ceac254901c3a6bc9231d7e0b3caa41dffb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,230,206,172,37,73,1,195,166,188,146,49,215,224,179,202,164,29,255,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
