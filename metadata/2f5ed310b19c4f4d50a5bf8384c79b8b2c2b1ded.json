Trouble is, there's no way to determine where a particular life might fall along fortune's spectrum. For every child born into the lap of luxury, there's another born on the point of a knife. There are no guarantees as to what may transpire as the immediate present unfolds into the uncertain future. Things change in an instant. Two things, however, are certain. Everyone will suffer. And everyone will die. Back to where we came from. Knowing this, and understanding full well that any particular life embodies the potential for experiencing extreme pain and unhappiness unceasing in some cases is procreation really worth the risk? Jim Crawford doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe it is. In Confessions of an Antinatalist, Crawford reflects on what it means to exist in the belly of a ravening serpent-life whose only prey is itself, and whose teeth are very, very sharp.\n\n180 pages\nPublisher: Nine-Banded Books; 1 edition (April 20, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0989697266\nISBN-13: 978-0989697262","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f5ed310b19c4f4d50a5bf8384c79b8b2c2b1ded","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+an+Antinatalist+%282010%29+by+Jim+Crawford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f5ed310b19c4f4d50a5bf8384c79b8b2c2b1ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,94,211,16,177,156,79,77,80,165,191,131,132,199,155,139,44,43,29,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
