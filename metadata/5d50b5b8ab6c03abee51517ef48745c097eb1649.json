The film was made on location and at Riverside Studios, London. In several respects, including some common casting, it was a precursor of the more anarchic St. Trinian's films of the 1950s.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d50b5b8ab6c03abee51517ef48745c097eb1649","amp;dn":"The+Happiest+Days+of+your+Life+B%2FW+1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d50b5b8ab6c03abee51517ef48745c097eb1649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,80,181,184,171,108,3,171,238,81,81,126,244,135,69,192,151,235,22,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
