He mentored George W. Bush and Karl Rove while leading the Republican party to historic victories, helping make liberal a dirty word, and transforming the way America elects our Presidents. In eye-opening interviews with elite Republicans and friends of Atwater, Boogie Man sheds new light on his crucial role in America's shift to the right. To Democrats offended by the 1988 Willie Horton controversy, Atwater was a remorseless political assassin aptly dubbed by one Congresswoman &quot;the most evil man in America.&quot; But he remains a hero to many Republicans for his irreverent sense of humor, his deep understanding of the American heartland, and his unapologetic vision of politics as war. This film builds to a moving portrait of a cynic's desperate deathbed search for meaning. After Boogie Man, you won't see American politics the same way again!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722518975a9b35cec7f97c352ebfe9f3bb1880b5","amp;dn":"Boogie.Man.The.Lee.Atwater.Story.2008.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722518975a9b35cec7f97c352ebfe9f3bb1880b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,37,24,151,90,155,53,206,199,249,124,53,46,191,233,243,187,24,128,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
