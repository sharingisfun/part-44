Coverage progresses from aspects of thermodynamics, bonds and interaction forces, and reaction kinetics, to transport phenomena, polymers, colloidal interactions, nucleation, glass transitions and freezing, and soft solids. This comprehensive volume effectively clarifies the physicochemical processes encountered in food product development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985f462b1eae55abff939803e91c9be1d6cc5392","amp;dn":"Physical+Chemistry+of+Foods+%28Food+Science+and+Technology+121%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985f462b1eae55abff939803e91c9be1d6cc5392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,95,70,43,30,174,85,171,255,147,152,3,233,28,155,225,214,204,83,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
