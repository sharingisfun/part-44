The bulk of this disc is actually a KSAN radio broadcast from October of 1973. The Band was kicked off the Sly and the Family Stone tour, but before they went back home to Jamaica they had one last comittment to fufill and it was this engagement at the KSAN Record Plant Studios. The only downside to this cd is that the running order is not that of the actual broadcast and the interview here is not from that same year but rather 1975 or those whereabouts. The I shot the sheriff included in this release is actually the version from the other night of the Lyceum concerts in London(Live! album from 1975). I actually prefer the version of I Shot the Sheriff on Talkin' Blues to the version on the Live! album. Another note is that not all the original Wailers are present for this recording at the KSAN studios. Peter Tosh, Bob Marley and the Barrett Brothers are on this recording but Bunny Wailer is not. Joe Higgs who originally taught the group how to sing in the 1960's in Jamaica takes the place of Bunny Wailer on this tour. Bunny Wailer grew tired of touring and someone was needed to replace him in the band, so Peter and Bob both called on Joe Higgs who happily agreed to join them for the 1973 American tour. In case you are wondering the real order of the KSAN setlist, it is as follows \n1. Rastaman Chant \n2. Bend down low \n3. Slave Driver \n4. You can't blame the youth \n5. Stop that train \n6. Burnin' and Lootin' \n7. Kinky Reggae \n8. Get up, Stand up \n9. Lively up yourself \n10.Walk the proud land\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Talkin' - 1\n[02] Talkin' Blues\n[03] Talkin' - 2\n[04] Burnin' &amp; Lootin'\n[05] Talkin' - 3\n[06] Kinky Reggae\n[07] Get Up Stand Up\n[08] Talkin' - 4\n[09] Slave Driver\n[10] Talkin' - 5\n[11] Walk The Proud Land\n[12] Talkin' - 6\n[13] You Can't Blame The Youth\n[14] Talkin' - 7\n[15] Rastaman Chant\n[16] Talkin' - 8\n[17] Am-A-Do\n[18] Talkin' - 9\n[19] Bend Down Low\n[20] Talkin' - 10\n[21] I Shot The Sheriff\n \n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:01m:43s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 154mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork    \t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Reggae\n\nOriginally Released\t- 04 February 1991\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Island Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://web.bobmarley.com/index.jsp \n\t\t\t- \n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/bobmarley\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc2326beb04d7c187b9b835e88de1067087951e","amp;dn":"%5B1991%5D+Talkin+Blues+-+Bob+Marley+-+154mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc2326beb04d7c187b9b835e88de1067087951e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,194,50,107,235,4,215,193,135,185,184,53,232,141,225,6,112,135,149,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
