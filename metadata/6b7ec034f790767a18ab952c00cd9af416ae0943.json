In mixed-mode device and circuit simulation, numerically simulated devices can be embedded in circuits consisting of compact device models and passive elements.\n\nMinimos-NT is integrated with a state-of-the-art TCAD Framework. A comprehensive set of physical models enables the user to simulate various kinds of advanced device structures, such as present-day CMOS devices, silicon-on-insulator devices, and hetero-structure devices. Taking into account atomistic traps and dopants, MINIMOS-NT allows reliability and variability modeling of highly scaled transistors such as bulk planar devices silicon-on-insulator FinFETs with a channel length down to 22 nm and below.\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7ec034f790767a18ab952c00cd9af416ae0943","amp;dn":"minimos+nt+2+1+install+linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7ec034f790767a18ab952c00cd9af416ae0943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,126,192,52,247,144,118,122,24,171,149,44,0,205,154,244,22,174,9,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
