Well any list is going to be subjective as hell, but if you're like me and \n\ndon't want to have to sift through a bunch of shovelware every time you want to play a game, I think this is a \n\ndamn good starting point for a collection.\n\nIn addition to the clean ROMs, I have included pre-patched games with translation, re-translation, de-censorship \n\nand bug fix patches. There are also a few general improvement hacks that I've included that can easily be \n\nignored, like the 2 player hack for Secret of Evermore and the 3 player hack for Seiken Densetsu 3. I've also \n\nincluded the romhacks listed on the wiki.\n\nIn each archive there is a &quot;~notes.txt&quot; file. This says what database I used to verify that set and sometimes \n\nexplains why a certain game is missing, or why a game is named differently than what the database has it marked \n\nas.\n\nIt's entirely possible I mis-patched some files, especially with the SNES games with their headered/unheadered \n\nnonsense. If any of the patched games give you trouble, check its entry on romhacking.net to see if it's \n\ncompatible with your emulator first before making a post. I tried to make it clear as to what patches where used \n\nso they can easily be looked up for this reason among others. If there's nothing helpful there, then please \n\nleave a comment letting me know specifically which file is the problem and I'll try to have it fixed for the \n\nnext release. I will not however help you set up emulators, so don't ask.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51815697881699209c12b61195375898fa03a8d4","amp;dn":"v%27s+Recommended+Games+Sets+2014-09-17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51815697881699209c12b61195375898fa03a8d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,129,86,151,136,22,153,32,156,18,182,17,149,55,88,152,250,3,168,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
