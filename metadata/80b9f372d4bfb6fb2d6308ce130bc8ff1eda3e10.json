But just how did the Ã¢â‚¬ËœFlying FinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ \nget on the road to becoming a Grand Prix Hero? \n\nThis fascinating programme is filled with rarely seen footage \nshowing how a shy teenager blossomed into one of the hottest \nproperties in motorsport. Alongside track action, there are \nextensive interviews with the racer as he progresses towards \nFormula One glory. Racing from the age of 5, we take up the story \nin 1987 when the then 19-year-old Hakkinen stepped into a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœslicks \nand wingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ car for the very first time, testing a FF2000 machine \nat Donington. \n\nThe short test earned him vital sponsorship and a full season in \nthe Opel Lotus Euroseries in 1988, where Hakkinen marked himself \nout as the man of the future against such rivals as Heinz-Harald \nFrentzen, Allan McNish and David Brabham. We enjoy action-packed \nracing from Zandvoort, Paul Ricard, SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Knutstorp and Jerez \nas a determined Hakkinen digs deep to secure the title by a single \npoint. \n\nThe action moves to Formula 3, including racing from Monaco and \nSilverstone, where the young Finn attracted the attentions of the \nGrand Prix paddock with a drive from 15th to 5th. This programme \nalso includes rare footage of Hakkinen in his only F3000 drive, \ntesting for Rene Arnoux at Le Mans. We see the initial apprehension \nreplaced by intelligent analysis as the enthused young driver \nreturns to the pits after a taste of real power. \n\nHowever, there would be no F3000 drive. The Lotus Formula One team \nsnapped up Hakkinen for the 1991 Grand Prix season, and we see the \nSilverstone test which secured him the seat. It is the first time \nHakkinen sat in an F1 car, and he immediately impressed Lotus boss \nPeter Collins, who reveals in an interview his admiration for his \nnew charge. \n\nOf course, it is behind the wheel of a McLaren Formula One car that \nHakkinen is best remembered, and archive footage from 1993 shows him \ngetting his first taste of the MP4/8 alongside first Michael \nAndretti and then the great Ayrton Senna. It is a delight to have \naccess to the rarefied atmosphere of a McLaren test in the presence \nof a legend, and a legend-in-the-making Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially when they take \nto the testing track! \n\nThe film concludes with HakkinenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s installation as McLarenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s number \n1 driver in 1994, the final piece in the jigsaw which would lead to \nrace wins and championship glory in 1998 and 1999, and secure \nHakkinenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place as a Grand Prix Hero","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b9f372d4bfb6fb2d6308ce130bc8ff1eda3e10","amp;dn":"Grand+Prix+Heroes+-+Mika+Hakkinen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b9f372d4bfb6fb2d6308ce130bc8ff1eda3e10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,185,243,114,212,191,182,251,45,99,8,206,19,11,200,255,30,218,62,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
