His mother and grandmother dote on him while he battles with his addiction to injecting cocaine into his veins. Although he conquered his battle with heroin, his addiction to IV drug use remained. Now, Anthony works days at the pizza restaurants owned by his many siblings but spends nights in his car, needle in his arm. Truly, a fantastic look at addiction to the needle. Also, prior to this episode, I didn't even know shooting cocaine was a thing people did. But that's where Anthony's longing led him. Intervention, Season 3, Episode 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cf58de6171e042c011121abef3efad59d6d108","amp;dn":"Intervention+S03E04+-+Anthony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cf58de6171e042c011121abef3efad59d6d108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,207,88,222,97,113,224,66,192,17,18,26,190,243,239,173,89,214,209,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
