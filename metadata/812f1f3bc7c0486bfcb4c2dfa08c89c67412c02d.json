Scheer had concluded that it is technically and environmentally feasible to harness enough solar radiation to achieve a total replacement of the foclear (fossil/nuclear) energy system by a global renewable energy economy. The main obstacle to such a change is seen to be political, not technical or economic.[2] In 1999 he was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs that were the major source of the rise of renewable energies in Germany during the following years.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:812f1f3bc7c0486bfcb4c2dfa08c89c67412c02d","amp;dn":"TIME%27S+Green+Cent+HERO+Scheer+%5Btxt%5D+Solar+Economy+-++ScanSoft+Da","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"812f1f3bc7c0486bfcb4c2dfa08c89c67412c02d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,47,31,59,199,192,72,107,252,180,194,223,160,140,137,198,116,18,192,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
