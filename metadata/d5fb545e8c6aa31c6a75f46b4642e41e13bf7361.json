They were adapted for the high-speed dashes through the Union blockade which closed off all the major Southern ports, and for much of the war they brought much-needed food, clothing and weaponry to the Confederacy.\nThis book traces their operational history, including the development of purpose-built blockade running ships, and examines their engines, crews and tactics.
