However, as I started to work on older authors I found that the real diversity is in all the different versions that exist. Therefore, this is my second try at an EXHAUSTIVE collection, as opposed to a complete one.\n\n1. Checked for completeness. Most of the versions were ripped by ME, but the ones from the internet were checked.\n\n2. Equalized volume. Many audio books, especially ones digitized from cassette tapes, have crazily varying volumes. I have equalized volumes so there shouldn't be any sudden jumps.\n\n3. FULLY CHAPTERIZED. This took many weeks. Each audio book was compiled into a single file (deleting bits like &quot;this concludes disc 2, please insert disc 3&quot;) and then separated into Parts and Chapters as defined by the original books. I find this to be the best way to enjoy audiobooks and it is perfect for iPods.\n\n4. Dehissed and noise-cleaned. When needed, I performed low pass filters and deleted pops in the audio.\n\n5. Encoded all books to a uniform MP3 96kbps 44.1kHz.\n\n6. ID3 Tagged. All audio book files have been fully ID3 tagged including full COVER ART.\n\nAnd so I present this nearly 18gb torrent of Austen goodness. I have included every single version of every single unabridged Jane Austen audiobook I could find in high quality spanning the internet and over 80 libraries. This torrent was a labor of love and took many weeks of preparation so I hope people will be excited to hear these classics read by such excellent and diverse readers. This is the second of several massively exhaustive torrents that I intend to upload.\n\nI consider this torrent to be celebration not only of Jane Austen, but of most of the best audiobook narrators in the world. The performances range from very good past excellent to downright incredible.\n\nPlease leave any comments, questions, or suggestions you might have as they are HIGHLY APPRECIATED! :)\n\nEnjoy!\n--CL8\n\n\n-------------Included in this torrent-------------\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Donada Peters) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Flo Gibson) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Juliet Stevenson) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Nadia May) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Sarah Badel) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Susannah Harker) -- also ripped by me\n1811 - Sense and Sensibility (read by Wanda McCaddon) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Emilia Fox) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Flo Gibson) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Irene Sutcliffe)\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Josephine Bailey) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Kate Redding) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Lindsay Duncan) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Michael Page) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Nadia May) -- also ripped by me\n1813 - Pride and Prejudice (read by Sharon Williams) -- also ripped by me\n1814 - Mansfield Park (read by Flo Gibson) -- also ripped by me\n1814 - Mansfield Park (read by Frances Barber)\n1814 - Mansfield Park (read by Johanna Ward) -- also ripped by me\n1814 - Mansfield Park (read by Wanda McCaddon) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Donada Peters) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Juliet Stevenson) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Michael Page) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Nadia May) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Prunella Scales) -- also ripped by me\n1815 - Emma (read by Victoria Morgan)\n1817 - Northanger Abbey (read by Carmella Ross)\n1817 - Northanger Abbey (read by Donada Peters) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Northanger Abbey (read by Flo Gibson) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Northanger Abbey (read by Juliet Stevenson) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Northanger Abbey (read by Nadia May) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Persuasion (read by Anna Massey)\n1817 - Persuasion (read by Flo Gibson) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Persuasion (read by Michael Page) -- also ripped by me\n1817 - Persuasion (read by Nadia May)\n\nalso I have included the following short stories:\n1804 - The Watsons (read by Carmella Ross)\n1805 - Lady Susan (read by Carmella Ross)\n1817 - Sanditon (read by Carmella Ross)\n\nPLUS a complete collection of Jane Austen eBooks.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a55207f2b951f8688afff4fb79f3b1406c189c","amp;dn":"The+Jane+Austen+Audiobook+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a55207f2b951f8688afff4fb79f3b1406c189c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,165,82,7,242,185,81,248,104,138,255,244,251,121,243,177,64,108,24,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
