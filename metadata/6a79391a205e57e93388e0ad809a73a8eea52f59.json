The fictional ship Antonia Graza featured in the movie is based on a real life Italian ocean liner, the SS Andrea Doria, which sank in 1956 after colliding with the MS Stockholm near Nantucket, Massachusetts, USA. The film grossed a total of $30,113,491 in the U.S. Box Office and stars Gabriel Byrne, Julianna Margulies and Emily Browning.\n\n\n\nA salvage crew has retrieved a sinking ship in the open ocean. They bring the ship into port and receive its salvage value from the authorities. While celebrating their success at a bar, Jack Ferriman, a Canadian Air Force pilot, approaches them and says he has spotted a mysterious vessel running adrift in the Bering Sea. Because the ship is in international waters, it can be claimed by whomever is able to bring it to a port. The crew soon set out on the Arctic Warrior, a small tugboat. While exploring the abandoned ship, they discover that it is the Antonia Graza, an Italian luxury liner that disappeared in May 1962 and was believed to be lost at sea. The ocean liner's disappearance was well known at the time.\n\n\nGeneral\nFile size                        : 701 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1127 Kbps\n\n\nVideo\nBit rate                         : 995 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 159 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\nJacket DVD @600dpi\n\n\n\n\nand you're welcome..:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a79391a205e57e93388e0ad809a73a8eea52f59","amp;dn":"Ghost+Ship+2002+%5BH.264-MP4%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a79391a205e57e93388e0ad809a73a8eea52f59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,121,57,26,32,94,87,233,51,136,224,173,128,154,115,168,238,165,47,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
