He had formed his legendary band, fifteen years ago, and after all this time, he didn&amp;#039;t lose anything from his inspiration, his sharpness and his talent. Maybe, you can blame him for not being rousing enough for the faster songs such as &quot;money for nothing&quot; or &quot;the bug&quot; but he knows very well how to be peaceful and calm for the gorgeous ballads &quot;on every street&quot;, &quot;brothers in arms&quot;. Moreover, he&amp;#039;s supported by a handful of musicians in great form, especially the drummer and the percussionist. The concert unanimously acclaimed by the fans,reaches its highest point with the wistful and entrancing &quot;local hero&quot;. At the end, a good but a bit listless concert. Nevertheless, Dire Straits&amp;#039; fans will find something in it.\n\n\nRuntime: USA:90 min \nSystem: PAL\n4:3\nAudio: English Dolby Digital 2.0\nDVD5 No Compression\nExtra features: Song selection\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\nCalling Elvis \nWalk Of Life \nHeavy Fuel \nRomeo And Juliet\nThe Bug \nPrivate Investigations \nYour Latest Trick\nOn Every Street \nYou And Your Friend \nMoney For Nothing \nBrothers In Arms \nSolid Rock \nLocal Hero - Wild Theme\n\n\nMore details: www.dvdquorum.es","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ebba4730beaa5e84fae8569b121aa2224a3bc3","amp;dn":"Dire_Straits_On_the_Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ebba4730beaa5e84fae8569b121aa2224a3bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,235,186,71,48,190,170,94,132,250,232,86,155,18,26,162,34,74,59,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
