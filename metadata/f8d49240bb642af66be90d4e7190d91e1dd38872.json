In turn, bandit, transvestite, street fighter, brothel cook, convict and father to seven adopted children, dos Santos--better known as Madame SatÃƒÂ£--was also a notorious gay performer who pushed social boundaries in a volatile time. The story begins in 1932, in Rio de Janeiro's bohemian Lapa district, when JoÃƒÂ£o Francisco is about to achieve his dream: becoming a stage star. In the sordid yet lively world of Lapa--populated by pimps, prostitutes and other denizens of Rio's underworld--JoÃƒÂ£o battles the streets and presides over a surrogate family that includes the charming prostitute Laurita, and her baby daughter whom everyone dotes on; the flamboyant hustler Taboo; JoÃƒÂ£o's teenage lover, Renatinho; and Amador, the owner of the Blue Danube club which is their second home.\n\n\n\nSubs srt: English / French / Spanish / Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d49240bb642af66be90d4e7190d91e1dd38872","amp;dn":"Madame+Sata+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d49240bb642af66be90d4e7190d91e1dd38872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,212,146,64,187,100,42,246,107,233,13,78,113,144,217,30,29,211,136,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
