The band name was invented strictly for appearances in order to make the group look like a real band rather than a tossed salad of random artists.\n\nMany of 1910's song titles took their names from children's schoolyard games and expressions while the content centered on high-school teen love.  Hits include &quot;Simon Says&quot;, &quot;1, 2, 3 Red Light&quot;, &quot;Goody Goody Gumdrops&quot;, and &quot;Indian Giver&quot;.\n\nTrack list:\n01. Simon Says\n02.
