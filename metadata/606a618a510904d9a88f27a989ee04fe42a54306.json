But with the recent global recession, the world economy has changed forever. Now the old toolsÃ¢â‚¬â€most notably supply-chain managementÃ¢â‚¬â€are no longer enough. In a new digital age characterized by over-supply and too many product types in almost every market, the new challenge is to locate and capture the elusive pools of high-profit demand.\n\nRick Kash and David Calhoun have the answer: a revolutionary, demand-driven model that has already proved successful for some of the world's most admired companies, including Best Buy, Anheuser-Busch, Hershey's, and Allstate. At the heart of this powerful new business model is an achievable vision for a new kind of winning company, one that uses sophisticated new tools and techniques to discover, characterize, and then serve these pools of high-profit demandÃ¢â‚¬â€and in the process gain pricing power in that market. Kash and Calhoun show how to use everything from social networks to more revealing and effective consumer-research techniques and then introduce the demand chain, the logical new partner to your supply chain. The authors' principles, case histories, and insights will help your business run faster, cut costs, and become better able to deliver high-quality products and services, even in the tightest economic climate.\n\nHow Companies Win is a compelling call to action to engage every level within a company, small or large, local or global","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606a618a510904d9a88f27a989ee04fe42a54306","amp;dn":"How+Companies+Win+OnlyGill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606a618a510904d9a88f27a989ee04fe42a54306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,106,97,138,81,9,4,217,168,143,39,169,137,238,4,254,66,165,67,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
