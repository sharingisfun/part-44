The next step will be creating a low-poly version. When this is finished we will take a look how to unwrap elements in order to create the UV Layout. Then we move on to baking ambient occlusion and normals maps. We use Render To Texture dialog in 3ds Max to accomplish this.\n\nAfter we finish it we'll move over to Photoshop and start to create a diffuse map as well as a specular map. Lastly we'll check our results in Marmoset Toolbag.\n\nCreating a Game-Ready Tommy Gun in 3ds Max content:\n\n1. Introduction and project overview\n2. Overview of the tool and starting modeling\n3.
