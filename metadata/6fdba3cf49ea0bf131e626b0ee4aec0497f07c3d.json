Each episode follows one tank's story: the rebuild; the innovations that made each machine great, and the engineering flaws that proved fatal. Unique serial numbers lead us to re-trace each tank's forged-in-war history: discovering where it was made, the battles it fought and the often tragic end of its fighting career. Once the hard work is over, we see the machines sputter and roar to life.\n\nDirector : PJ Naworynski\nExecutive Producer for Military Channel : Peter Rees\nAn Ellis Vision Production with Viasat Explorer, UKTV, Canwest and Military Channel (2009)\n\n\nEpisode 4 : The BMP\nUnveiled in the mid-1960s, the Soviet BMP was the world's very first infantry fighting vehicle - a brand new concept for the modern nuclear battlefield. The BMP was designed to protect soldiers from radioactive fallout and allow them to fight from within the vehicle. But the BMP never fought a nuclear war. Instead it fought conventional wars in the Middle East where it was outclassed by its vastly superior American counterpart, the M2 Bradley. Now, Greg Taylor, one of the most experienced tank restorers, will rebuild a Cold War vehicle without enough money, time, and help. Greg is pushed to his limits.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2133 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.792:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 48:52.080\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 854,833,152 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fdba3cf49ea0bf131e626b0ee4aec0497f07c3d","amp;dn":"Military.Channel.Tank.Overhaul.Series2.4of4.The.BMP.XviD.AC3..av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fdba3cf49ea0bf131e626b0ee4aec0497f07c3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,219,163,207,73,234,11,241,49,230,38,176,238,74,236,4,151,240,124,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
