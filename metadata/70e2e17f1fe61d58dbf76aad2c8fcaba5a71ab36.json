In an interview with Los Angeles Times, Ben Moody said that We are the Fallen Evanescence is different from equality in the group and more energy, which never managed to achieve in Evanescence. He added: &quot;We're not trying to be somebody. If we like something, it's because the music was created by us.&quot; The group consists of: former members of Evanescence - Ben Moody, John LeCompt, Rocky Gray, as well as Carly Smithson and Marty O'Brien.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e2e17f1fe61d58dbf76aad2c8fcaba5a71ab36","amp;dn":"We+Are+The+Fallen+-+Tear+The+World+Down+-+2010%2C+FLAC+%28tracks%2Bcue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e2e17f1fe61d58dbf76aad2c8fcaba5a71ab36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,226,225,127,31,230,29,88,219,247,106,173,44,143,202,186,90,113,171,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
