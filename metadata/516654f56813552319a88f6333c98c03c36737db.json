It is nearly a year since the new Pope was installed, but still the same problems dog the Catholic Church. A UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has just criticised the Vatican over its failure to deal decisively with child sexual abuse by priests, gay rights activists still attack the Church on its stand on homosexuality, and the Vatican's finances have been under scrutiny and criminal investigation.\n\nHARDtalk speaks to Cardinal Peter Turkson who, last year, was tipped to become the first black Pope. He is calling for financial reforms and action against poverty and inequality. But does the Catholic Church have the moral authority to take a lead on such issues?\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:516654f56813552319a88f6333c98c03c36737db","amp;dn":"The+Catholic+Church+Interrogated++%28BBC+Hardtalk+-+Feb+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"516654f56813552319a88f6333c98c03c36737db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,102,84,245,104,19,85,35,25,168,143,99,51,201,140,3,195,103,55,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
