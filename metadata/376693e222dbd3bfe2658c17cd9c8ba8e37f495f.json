Geometric patterns spread across the skin, until the victim dies in agony or becomes a Carrier, doing the bidding of an evil intelligence. The lost prince Sarmin, the emperor's only surviving brother, lies locked in a hidden room. As the pattern draws closer to the palace he is at last remembered: now he awaits a bride, Mesema, a Windreader from the northern plains.\n\nShe is accustomed to riding free across the grasslands and finds the Imperial Court stifling, but she soon realizes the politicking is not a game. It is deadly earnest. Eyul, the imperial assassin, is burdened by the atrocities he has committed. As commanded, he bears the emperor's Knife to the desert in search of a cure for the pattern-markings.\n\nAs long-planned conspiracies boil over into open violence, the enemy moves towards victory. Now only three people stand in his way: a lost prince, a world-weary killer, and a young girl from the steppes who saw a path in a pattern once, among the waving grasses.\n\n\nBook 2: Knife Sworn\n\nAmbitious generals and restless soldiers want war at any cost. An insidious foreign religion stirs fear among the people and the court. And the emperor's own heart is torn between two very different women: Mesema, a Windreader princess of the northern plains, and Grada, a lowborn untouchable with whom Sarmin shares a unique bond.\n\nA natural-born mage, Sarmin also carries within him a throng of bodiless spirits whose conflicting memories and desires force him to wage a private battle for his sanity. In times past, a royal assassin known as the Emperor's Knife served as the keen edge of justice, defending the throne from any and all menaces, but the last Knife has perished and his successor has yet to be named. For his own safety, and that of the empire, Sarmin must choose his own loyal death-dealerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but upon whom can be he bestow the bloody burden of the Knife-Sworn? \n\n\nBook 3: The Tower Broken\n\nThe world is at its breaking point. The nothing, a terrible darkness caused by the festering wounds of a god, bleeds out the very essence of all, of stone, silkand souls. Emperor Sarmin thought he had stopped it, but it is spreading toward his city, Cerana and he is powerless to halt the destruction. Even as Cerana fills with refugees, the Yrkmen armies arrive with conquest in mind, but they offer to spare SarminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people if they will convert to the Mogyrk faith.\n\nTime is running out for Sarmin and his wife, Mesema. The MageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower is cracked; the last mage, sent to find a mysterious pattern-worker in the desert, has vanished; and Sarmin believes his kidnapped brother, Daveed, still has a part to play. The walls are crumbling around themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n\n\nHappy Listening :)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:376693e222dbd3bfe2658c17cd9c8ba8e37f495f","amp;dn":"Complete+Mazarkis+Williams+-+Tower+and+Knife+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"376693e222dbd3bfe2658c17cd9c8ba8e37f495f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,102,147,226,34,219,211,191,226,101,140,23,205,156,139,168,227,127,73,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
