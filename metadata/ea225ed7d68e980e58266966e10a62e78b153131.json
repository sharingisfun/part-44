Sarahâ€™s WordPress tutorial walks you through creating a website yourself using step-by-step lessons that are easy to follow. Making a website as a beginner has never been easier!\r\n\r\nWhy should you build your own website on your own domain instead of using a free service?\r\nThe answer is that, with your own privately registered domain and hosting account, YOU own and control the website, not anybody else. You can put whatever you like on your site and no-one can tell you otherwise. You can make your site look and behave how you like. Youâ€™re the boss.\r\n\r\nAnd, with your own website, you can build your own distinctive â€˜brandâ€™, whether you are a business or a community group, an individual, or whatever... Your domain becomes your own exclusive web address, your own piece of online virtual â€˜real estateâ€™ that plays its part in publicizing your mission or message. Creating a website on your own domain gives you identity, visibility and, indeed, status.\r\n\r\nBut donâ€™t you need a professional web designer to make a good job building a website?\r\n\r\nNo, definitely not! This was the case in the early days of the Internet because only a few tech-savvy geeks knew and understood the computer language (HTML) required. But as the technology has advanced, so have the tools to build websites become more accessible. WordPress is one of these tools and WordPress is the subject of this e-book.\r\n\r\nBut how much does it cost to make a website?\r\n\r\nThe answer is just a few bucks per month for hosting. If you create your own website using WordPress, you donâ€™t have to spend another cent.\r\n\r\nAnd what if youâ€™re looking to start a blog?\r\n\r\nWell, the same instructions apply. WordPress was originally designed as a blogging platform and this ebook shows you just how to build a blog using the same techniques as designing a website.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to create a simple WordPress blog or design a full-blown ecommerce site, Sarah's 'WordPress To Go' will start you off on the right foot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea225ed7d68e980e58266966e10a62e78b153131","amp;dn":"WordPress+To+Go+by+Sarah+McHarry+%282013%29+%5Bpdf+%26amp%3B+epub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea225ed7d68e980e58266966e10a62e78b153131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,34,94,215,214,142,152,14,88,38,105,102,225,10,98,231,139,21,49,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
