This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\n\nWARNING: If you limit your upload speed during the download in initial seeding phase (when I am single seeder) FOR WHATEVER REASON, you'll be kicked-out for good. What's going to be later, I couldn't care less, and it's up to your consciousness in relation to other people. Any ratio below 1.084 for sure means death of P2P, torrents and whole idea of sharing.\n\nI am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think I'm some kind of &quot;free launch&quot; downloading service. NO - IT'S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \nAlso, in the future, if I spot something like kind of gang-banging of innocents, you'll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things I've just said, please - go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And don't come back. Please.\n\nMany people - even if they think otherwise - cannot make a distinction between &quot;normal&quot; swarm and the swarm where initial-seedeing is performed. They say &quot;OK, 0/1 seeder&quot;; but infact, they do not recognize all implications of joining to initial-seeding swarm. To keep it short and simple, if anyone need/wants to save on traffic - for whatever reason - better is to stay away and wait till more than four stable seeders are present. Initial swarms are for the people who CAN put upload/download speed at 1:1 ratio - all other &quot;types of behaviour&quot; leads to semi-catastrophic consequences, not only to individual peer, but to ALL peers in specific swarm.\nWhy is that, I've explained numerous times on name-not-to-be-spoken - and I might post this Q&amp;A part of the text here. Maybe.\n\nIMPORTANT: Torrents, especially of UK shows, are under constant and coordinated attack from British-based IP numbers. If you see number of peers with very, very similar address block them all (block range) with your firewall.\nTheir MO is called &quot;byte-thrashers&quot;; they aggressively pull bytes from normal peers, causing other &quot;normal&quot; peers to tag you as &quot;uncooperative&quot; since all newer torrent programs have built-in Friend or Foe mechanism. \nNormal clients receive nothing from you ('cause you gave packets to &quot;gremlins&quot;) and doesn't give you back any byte - simple as that. \nCompanies currently pay agencies and individuals to starve us to death (byte-wise and otherwise). Do not let them to get richer, and let us just to wave to their Jags, Porschs and yachts.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT:\n\n1st. New torrent programs are &quot;smarter&quot; than old ones. They do not allow blatant leeching, if YOU do not give, you'll get NOTHING from others. So, imagine a situation when 10 of 16 morons join the initial seeding.\n\n2nd New torrent programs NEED 60-70 kB/s upload speed JUST to maintain stabile connection to other side. So, TODAY, throttling down your upload speed doesn't look so smart, right?\n\n3rd I am not against cost-effectiveness, right, as long it doesn't compromise my main goal or purpose. I need 23 minutes for average comedy/cartoon show to upload, 46 minutes (in fact, less) for normal-length episode, hour and a half for average movie. I DO NOT have all the time in the world; I have my schedule, my rhythm and - my rules. Be nice, play fair, show respect and many things would be better, especially here.\n----------------------\n\nWhat goes around comes around. Give and you'll be given.\n\nI am a sort of refugee from &quot;minimalistic-was-a-star&quot;. Many of my friends, my &quot;Regulars&quot; came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to &quot;recognize&quot; my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. \n\nOne thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from &quot;Developed countries&quot; seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. \n\nWe also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological cushions our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases - and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the shiny world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have more must share with the ones who have less&quot;. Must. Other &quot;types&quot; of behaviour are not welcomed - here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.\n\nWe are the rebels by nature, that's why we are here on place called &quot;Pirate bay&quot; ...not to eat each other's hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac58f07dba5ac805fcf43c03e754733c1d5123f","amp;dn":"Damages.S03E04.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dac58f07dba5ac805fcf43c03e754733c1d5123f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,197,143,7,219,165,172,128,95,207,67,192,62,117,71,51,193,213,18,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
