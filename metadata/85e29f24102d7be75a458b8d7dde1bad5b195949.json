It argues that 'absolutist' ideas dating back to Plato continue to mislead generations of theoretical physicists and theologians. It explains that the multi-layered nature of our present descriptions of the world is unavoidable, not because of anything about the world but because of our own human natures. It tries to rescue mathematics from the singular and exceptional status that it has been assigned, as much by those who understand it as by those who do not. It provides direct quotations from many of the important contributors to its subject, and concludes with a penetrating criticism of many of the recent contributions to the often acrimonious debates about science and religions. \n\nHardcover: 256 pages \nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA (July 22, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e29f24102d7be75a458b8d7dde1bad5b195949","amp;dn":"Why+Beliefs+Matter%3A+Reflections+on+the+Nature+of+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e29f24102d7be75a458b8d7dde1bad5b195949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,226,159,36,16,45,123,231,90,69,139,141,125,222,27,173,91,25,89,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
