TinyOS is an open-source project which a large number of research universities and companies contribute to. The main TinyOS website, http://www.tinyos.net,has instructions for downloading and installing the TinyOS programming environment. The website has a great deal of useful information which this book doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t cover, such as common hardware platforms and how to install code on a node.\n\nThis book is the follow up of another book with same name by the same writer, published in 2006. This is a very useful resource for those who wants to get started with TinyOS programming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ecae32e1752385f158a35a60c0a23f6b1762f5","amp;dn":"TinyOS+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ecae32e1752385f158a35a60c0a23f6b1762f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,236,174,50,225,117,35,133,241,88,163,90,96,192,162,63,107,23,98,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
