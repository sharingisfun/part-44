This boss type is currently in testing, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to see them around much.\nAll bosses can now repair sails. Tier 3+ bosses can repair hull while docked and will automatically try to escape combat and get to a friendly town when low on health.\nAdded /reloadServerData to make the server reload its configuration data. Useful if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made local changes. This will also reload the admin and ban lists.\nTier 3 (dread lords) and higher bosses now see through fog.\nSingle player faction naming conventions will no longer affect multiplayer when going from SP to MP. It was always just a visual client-side change, so harmless regardless.\n\n\n== Instructions: \nStart the update and select your game folder to update.\n\n\n\n OTHER/INFO\n LuKeStorm\n=============\n\nAbout the Update\n Created from a clean and verified Steam installation.\n \n =====================================================================\n Greets: All who make quality work out of conviction!\n =====================================================================\n\n\n== Links:\nDownload 7-Zip http://www.7-zip.org/download.html\n\n\n\n           If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding!\n                   Support game development and buy the game!\n\n\nGame made by \nTasharen Entertainment Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbd7205b12bbf76bfc9549712ff5caa2c3b1df3","amp;dn":"Windward+%28Cumulative+Update+to+v2015-06-01.0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbd7205b12bbf76bfc9549712ff5caa2c3b1df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,189,114,5,177,43,191,118,191,201,84,151,18,255,92,170,44,59,29,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
