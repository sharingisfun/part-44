William Clark\n(1770-1838) to survey newly acquired lands and seek a Northwest\nPassage. Ordered by Thomas Jefferson (who labeled it the Corps of\nDiscovery), the expedition was approved by Congress in 1803, and\nseveral dozen men were trained in Illinois in the winter of 1803-04.\nOn May 14, 1804, the explorers departed from St. Louis, heading up\nthe Missouri River by keelboat and continuing westward over the\nRocky Mountains to the Pacific. Ken Burns spent almost four years on\nthis project, retracing the route with cameras capturing mountains,\nrivers, waterfalls, and forests at the same time of year as first\nseen by Lewis and Clark. Traditional and Native American music\nprovides an accompaniment to the grandeur of these vast vistas,\nwhile Stephen Ambrose and other historians offer illuminating\nanecdotes. Paintings and maps are intercut, but unlike other Burns\ndocumentaries, few archival photos are included (since photography\nwas not invented until decades later). Reenactments, seen at a\ndistance, are also kept at a bare minimum. The four-hour film\npremiered as a PBS two-parter on November 4-5, 1997.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e548c041e643079d0ce6135d50d7465c0fcc6c2","amp;dn":"Lewis+%26+Clark+-+The+Journey+of+the+Corps+of+Discovery+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e548c041e643079d0ce6135d50d7465c0fcc6c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,84,140,4,30,100,48,121,208,206,97,53,213,13,116,101,192,252,198,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
