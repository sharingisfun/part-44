Hamlet is the star, director, and brooding conscience of an android repertory troupe created for the priviliged thrill-seekers of decadent Manhattan society.\n\nOnly now, the human creator of the android ensemble has been brutally murdered, and Hamlet must stalk the fiend. He descends into the depths of the Orwellian society he has been programmed to serve, in order learn a terrible about the killer - and about himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f2fa678447e9fcae7995dd68a9c4c47a9a5c8d1","amp;dn":"Too%2C+Too+Solid+Flesh+by+Nick+O%27Donohoe+%28EPUB+MOBI+AZW3+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f2fa678447e9fcae7995dd68a9c4c47a9a5c8d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,47,166,120,68,126,159,202,231,153,93,214,138,156,76,71,169,165,200,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
