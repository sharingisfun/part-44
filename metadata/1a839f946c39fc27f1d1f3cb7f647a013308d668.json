He is never afraid to tackle and expose uncomfortable subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â€subjects most writers avoidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a master story teller.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJeffrey Siger was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He practiced law at a major Wall Street law firm and while there served as Special Counsel to the citizens group responsible for reporting on New York City's prison conditions. He left Wall Street to establish his own New York City law firm and continued as one of its name partners until giving it all up to write full-time among the people, life, and politics of his beloved Mykonos, his adopted home of thirty years. When not in Greece, he enjoys his other home, a farm outside New York City.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TARGET TINOS,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the fourth novel in his fast paced Chief Inspector Andreas Kaldis series, was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“superbÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a winnerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Publishers Weekly in a starred review. Ã¢â‚¬Å“MURDER IN MYKONOS,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first in the series, was Greece's #1 best selling English-language novel, a best seller in several U.S. markets, and picked by some reviewers as among the Ã¢â‚¬Å“best of 2009.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His second novel in the series, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ASSASSINS OF ATHENS,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ instantly became a top ten best seller in Greece, received critical acclaim as Ã¢â‚¬Å“international police procedural writing at its bestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Booklist, starred review), and gained best seller status in several U.S markets. Ã¢â‚¬Å“PREY ON PATMOS: An Aegean ProphecyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the third of his books to Ã¢â‚¬Å“immerse readers in a fascinating cultureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kirkus Reviews) that Ã¢â‚¬Å“proves that Greece is fertile new ground for the mystery genreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Library Journal). His work is published in the US (Poisoned Pen Press), Greece (Aikaterini Lalaouni Editions), Germany (Goldmann Publishing/Random House), and U.K. and Commonwealth countries (Piatkus Books/Little Brown).\n\nAndreas Kaldis Series:\n1. Murder in Mykonos\n2. Assassins of Athens\n3. An Aegean Prophecy\n4. Target: Tinos\n\nAll are US iBook ePubs converted to ePub, Mobi, and AZW3. Yes, I converted an ePub into ePub so that if added to Calibre all the metadata would be attached without having to do it yourself. Though the description has Prey on Patmos: An Aegean Prophecy as the 3rd book in the Series, Prey on Patmos was dropped in favor of just An Aegean Prophecy for US Release. I've read Murder in Mykonos and it is an AMAZING story. The rich, detailed descriptions of Greece and the outlying islands claimed by them give you a vivid picture to plant as you read.\n\nAny questions and/or comments are appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a839f946c39fc27f1d1f3cb7f647a013308d668","amp;dn":"Andreas+Kaldis+Series+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%2C+AZW3+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a839f946c39fc27f1d1f3cb7f647a013308d668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,131,159,148,108,57,252,39,241,209,243,203,127,100,122,1,51,8,214,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
