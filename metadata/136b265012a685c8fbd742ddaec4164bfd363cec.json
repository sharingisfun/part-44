That is why The Onion is publishing an audio world atlas: \nto help us. News that now makes no sense will now make sense; thus a \nnew age of enlightenment. Our Dumb World contains news and historic \nfacts from other nations, historic timelines for countries, and the \nearth broken down and described (from its molten core to the outermost \nsphere and the location of heaven), as well as demographic, economic, \nand other data about each country's people, industries, and habits.\n\nEvery country is categorized in a number of ways, including ethnic cleanliness, \nlevel of Bono activity, prop comedians per 1,000 live birds, yearly \nincome in wide-screen televisions, the monkeys they got, where it sees \nitself in five years, average skin color, benefits of invading said \ncountry, and most annoying handicrafts. Framed with informative essays \nand written by the full Onion staff, Our Dumb World is the first original \nOnion audiobook in eight years: a gut-busting send-up in which no nation \nescapes unscathed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:136b265012a685c8fbd742ddaec4164bfd363cec","amp;dn":"Our+Dumb+World%3A+The+Onion%27s+Atlas+of+the+Planet+Earth+%5BAudiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"136b265012a685c8fbd742ddaec4164bfd363cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,107,38,80,18,166,133,200,251,215,66,221,174,196,22,75,253,54,60,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
