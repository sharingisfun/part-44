Anthropologist and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Wade Davis leads us on a thrilling journey to celebrate the wisdom of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s indigenous cultures.\n\nIn Polynesia we set sail with navigators whose ancestors settled the Pacific ten centuries before Christ. In the Amazon we meet the descendants of a true Lost Civilization, the people of the Anaconda. In the Andes we discover that the Earth really is alive, while in the far reaches of Australia we experience Dreamtime, the all-embracing philosophy of the first humans to walk out of Africa. We then travel to Nepal, where we encounter a wisdom hero, a Bodhisattva, who emerges from forty-five years of Buddhist retreat and solitude. And finally we settle in Borneo, where the last rainforest nomads struggle to survive.\nUnderstanding the lessons of this journey will be our mission for the next century. For at risk is the human legacy a vast archive of knowledge and expertise, a catalogue of the imagination. Rediscovering a new appreciation for the diversity of the human spirit, as expressed by culture, is among the central challenges of our time.\nWADE DAVIS is the bestselling author of several books, including The Serpent and the Rainbow, Light at the Edge of the World, and One River. He is an award-winning anthropologist, ethnobotanist, filmmaker, and photographer. Davis currently holds the post of National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, and divides his time between Washington, D.C. and northern British Columbia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2058eaa0d76293832edee390f4a2fd2205d07f1c","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2008%5D+The+Wayfinders+Why+Ancient+Wisdom+Matters+in+the+Mo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2058eaa0d76293832edee390f4a2fd2205d07f1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,88,234,160,215,98,147,131,46,222,227,144,244,162,253,34,5,208,127,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
