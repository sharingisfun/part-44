Leonard, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. The screenplay was rewritten from the book for Sigmund Romberg's 1917 operetta Maytime by Rida Johnson Young, Romberg's librettist; however, only one musical number by Romberg was retained. The film's storyline greatly resembles that of NoÃƒÂ«l Coward's operetta Bitter Sweet, right down to the &quot;frame story&quot; surrounding the main plot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3102289c415c107a79029f9055cc72b3420e9a71","amp;dn":"Maytime.1937.576p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3102289c415c107a79029f9055cc72b3420e9a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,2,40,156,65,92,16,122,121,2,159,144,85,204,114,179,66,14,154,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
