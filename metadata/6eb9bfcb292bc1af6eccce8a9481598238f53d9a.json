Writer Patrick Brown provides the musical score and humorous story line. The show is built on Bible stories and set in the hills of Jamaica just after Hurricane Gilbert. Lead actors Oliver Samuels (Butcher) and Glen Campbell (Ras Noah) easily handle their roles and bring the audience along for their long and funny road in the fulfillment of God's commandment to Noah. The show is anchored in the Jamaican comic tradition of social commentary with gags, plays on words, and exaggerated contemporary attitudes courtesy of a great supporting cast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb9bfcb292bc1af6eccce8a9481598238f53d9a","amp;dn":"Ras.Noah.and.the.Hawk+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb9bfcb292bc1af6eccce8a9481598238f53d9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,185,191,203,41,43,193,175,110,204,206,138,148,129,89,130,56,245,61,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
