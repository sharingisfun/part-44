But as the wonders of childhood fade into the responsibilities of adulthood, MalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirits fade too. On his twenty-fifth birthday, disillusioned, Mal goes to bedÃ¢â‚¬â€back to his childhood bedÃ¢â‚¬â€and never emerges again. \n\nNarrated by MalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shy, diligent younger brother, Bed details MalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent extreme and increasingly grotesque transformation: immobility and a gargantuan appetite combine, over the course of two decades, to make him the fattest man in the world. Despite his seclusion and his refusal to explain his motivations, MalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition earns him worldwide notoriety and a cult of followers convinced he is making an important statement about modern life. But MalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions will also change the lives of his haunted parents, his brother and the woman they both love, Lou. \n\nIn Bed, David Whitehouse has put a magnifying glass on contemporary society. Hailed as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“momentousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Bookseller) debut in the UK, Bed is a mordantly funny and ultimately redemptive parable about mortality, obesity, celebrity, depression and the broken promises of adulthood. It is one of the most audacious debut novels in years.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7002596baf6589ba63c29fdbbc7210686663bc1","amp;dn":"David+Whitehouse+-+Bed+%28pdf%2Crtf%2Cepub%2Clit%2Clrf%2Cmobi%2Cfb2%2Cpdb%29+-+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7002596baf6589ba63c29fdbbc7210686663bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,0,37,150,186,246,88,155,166,60,41,253,187,199,33,6,134,102,59,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
