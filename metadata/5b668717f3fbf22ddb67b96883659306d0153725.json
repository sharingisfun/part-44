However, Frank feels lonely and often chats on the phone with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), a customer service agent who works for the GSA pension office in Kansas City. He creates opportunities to talk to her by tearing up his pension checks and calling her to say they had never arrived.\nHis life is disrupted when a six-person hit squad raids his house in the middle of the night. Frank handily kills the entire squad. Knowing they have tapped his phone, he goes to Kansas City to protect Sarah. She refuses to go, so he binds and gags her with duct tape and she becomes Frank's reluctant companion, while he tries to find out who is trying to kill him, and track down his old associates for help. Meanwhile, CIA agent William Cooper (Karl Urban) is assigned to hunt and kill Frank.\nFrank first goes to New Orleans and after leaving Sarah bound and gagged in their hotel room, he meets with his terminally ill mentor Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), living in a retirement community. Joe tells Frank that the same hit squad was also responsible for the murder of a reporter for The New York Times. Sarah manages to break free but is rescued by Frank when another agent, posing as a police officer, tries to drug her. Cooper attacks them but Frank tricks the police, so that the police arrest Cooper, which gives them time to escape. The two head to New York City and find clues left behind by the deceased reporter, which leads them to a hit list. They then track down Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), also a former black ops agent and a paranoid conspiracy theorist, to provide more information.\nAfter reading the list, Marvin tells them that the names on the list are all connected to a 1981 secret mission in Guatemala in which Frank and Marvin participated, and that one person, Gabriel Singer (James Remar), is still alive. The trio track down Singer, who tells them that the mission involved extracting a person from a village and that everybody on the list has been killed to silence them. Singer is then assassinated by a helicopter-borne machine-gunner, and the team escapes as Cooper closes in. Frank goes to ex-Russian secret agent Ivan Simanov (Brian Cox), offering him a favor in exchange for his help in infiltrating CIA headquarters. Along with Sarah, Frank gets inside and the records keeper (Ernest Borgnine) - who has much respect for Frank - simply hands him the Guatemala file. Frank goes to confront Cooper in his office and the two have a vicious fight. Though Frank was victorious, he is shot by Cooper during his escape. Having escaped an attempt on his life, Joe arrives and helps extract the team. They all hide out in the home of Victoria (Helen Mirren), who treats Frank's wound and - also missing her old life as a wetwork agent - joins the team.\nAfter reviewing the file, all the team can figure out is that the only man involved on the reporter's list but not in the file, Alexander Dunning (Richard Dreyfuss), has some way of protecting himself. Joe masquerades as a dictator from an unnamed country and secures a meeting with Dunning, who is an illegal arms dealer. As Victoria waits outside with Sarah to keep watch, Dunning reveals under interrogation that the mission was to extract the nowÃ¢â‚¬â€œVice President Robert Stanton (Julian McMahon), who at the time was a young lieutenant who massacred the village civilians, and that Stanton is trying to erase all the loose ends. At that moment, Cooper and the FBI surround Dunning's mansion. Cooper tries to negotiate Frank's surrender, but Frank tells Cooper about the vice president's treachery. Joe sacrifices himself by pretending to be Frank surrendering, and, as Joe exits the house, he is killed by an unknown sniper. The confusion, as well as Victoria's cover fire, buys the team enough time to escape, but Sarah falls down a slope and is captured. Frank calls Cooper from Cooper's family home and threatens the family if Sarah is harmed, and says that he intends to kill Stanton.\nThe team, along with Ivan, who is Victoria's former lover, infiltrate Stanton's fundraising gala in Chicago and successfully kidnap him despite Cooper's best efforts to stop them. Frank calls Cooper and says he is willing to trade Stanton for Sarah. At the meeting point, Dunning arrives and after a short dialogue shoots Stanton, revealing that he is the mastermind behind the assassinations and that Stanton was merely a pawn. Cooper's boss, Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon), is also in on the plot. Disgusted with Dunning and Wilkes' greed and corruption, Cooper pretends to go along with handcuffing Frank before shooting Wilkes while Marvin and Victoria kill Dunning's bodyguards, and Frank crushes Dunning's windpipe. Cooper agrees to let Frank and his team go and he is left to sort things out. As they leave the scene, Frank and Sarah are eager to start a new life together.\nIvan reminds Frank that he owes Ivan a favor. A few months later, Frank and Marvin are in Moldova, fleeing from Moldovan Army troops with a stolen nuclear device, with Marvin wearing a dress and in a wooden wheelbarrow being pushed by Frank.\n\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b668717f3fbf22ddb67b96883659306d0153725","amp;dn":"Red+2010.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b668717f3fbf22ddb67b96883659306d0153725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,102,135,23,243,251,242,45,219,103,185,104,131,101,147,6,208,21,55,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
