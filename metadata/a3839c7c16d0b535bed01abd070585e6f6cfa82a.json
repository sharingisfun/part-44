On May 18, 2006, Stacked was canceled, leaving five episodes unaired in the United States. The last episode aired on January 11, 2006. The five unaired episodes have since been aired in reruns in the UK, Israel and Switzerland. Stacked was hailed as the opposite of Cheers, instead of a smart person in a &quot;dumb&quot; place, it is based on the concept of a dumb person in a &quot;smart&quot; place. A workplace ensemble comedy, Stacked revolves around Skyler Dayton (Pamela Anderson) who is tired of her non-stop partying lifestyle and bad choices in boyfriends. Wanting a major life change, she wanders into &quot;Stacked Books&quot;, a small, family-run bookstore owned by Gavin Miller (Elon Gold) and his brother, Stuart (Brian Scolaro).[1][2]\n \nDivorced and unlucky in love himself, Gavin's inclined to regard Skyler as an embodiment of the vacuous, image-obsessed culture he has come to abhor. Stuart, however, is dazzled by Skyler's beauty and, much to Gavin's horror, offers her a job at their store, which she happily accepts as the first step in her quest for a steadier lifestyle. Unhappy that she's going to be minding the till next to such an intimidating bombshell is the store's sole other employee, Katrina (Marissa Jaret Winokur), who doles out doses of realism and cynicism. Rounding out the characters is the store's one steady customer, Harold March (Christopher Lloyd), a preeminent, but retired, rocket scientist.\nThis is uncut and **DOES CONTAIN COMMERCIALS** Tested for playback for PC with VLC and on TV with WD HDTV Media Player Source: Stream Capture Video Codec: MPEG-1/2 video (mpgv) Resolution: 896x512 Frame Rate: 50 Audio Codec: MPEG Audio layer 1/2/3 (mpga) Channels: Stereo Sample rate: 48,000hz Bitrate: 128kb/s **Stacked S02E13 The Headmaster** is a slightly lower quality then the rest of the episodes.
