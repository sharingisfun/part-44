With their combined background in electronic music of all angles Bolder introduces a significant proposition to the current experimental electronic boom. Blurring the lines between industrial, techno, dub, ambient and narrative forms, the work on Bolder's debut presents a dance amongst the abyss, a world where organic rhythms provide the path amongst a swarm of foreboding electronics. Herein lurks an atmosphere where hostile electronics weigh the hope and paranoia of today's climate. One humans listen is another humans challenge.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://editionsmego.com/release/eMEGO-185&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://editionsmego.com/release/eMEGO-185&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15f278eb9743ee836825e4c21bc00f6ff3f42b67","amp;dn":"Bolder+-+Hostile+Environment+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15f278eb9743ee836825e4c21bc00f6ff3f42b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,242,120,235,151,67,238,131,104,37,228,194,27,192,15,111,243,244,43,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
