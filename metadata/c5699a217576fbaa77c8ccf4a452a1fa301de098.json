With unprecedented access inside prison walls, it discovers what it's like to live with the threat of the death chamber, as well as hearing from victims and their families, and the family of those on death row - some praying for execution, some hoping for a reprieve. Each episode focuses on different aspects of the system - execution, punishment and the complex nature of 'truth'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Truth \r\nIn January 2014, Waynesville, Ohio, 18-year-old Justin Back is brutally murdered in his own home. Two of his 19-year-old friends, Austin Myers and Timothy Mosley, are arrested and charged with his murder. However both give very different versions of events, begging the question, who is telling the truth? With prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the crime, what will each one do to save themselves from the ultimate punishment? With access to the families of all three boys, the devastating nature of this gruesome crime and it's repercussions are revealed. It's one crime but will there be two different outcomes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ef/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/78/Life-and-Death-Row-Series-2-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2984 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b071jy7p\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Life%20And%20Death%20Row","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5699a217576fbaa77c8ccf4a452a1fa301de098","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+And+Death+Row+Series+2+3of3+Truth+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5699a217576fbaa77c8ccf4a452a1fa301de098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,105,154,33,117,118,251,170,119,200,204,244,164,82,161,250,48,29,224,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
