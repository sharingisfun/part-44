His father was a baptist preacher  who paid for piano lessons for his son[2], on condition he learned sacred melodies. But Ferguson had other ideas. &quot;After church was over, while the people was all standing outside talking, me and my friends would run back inside and I'd play the blues on the piano.&quot;\n\nAt the age of 19, he was on the road with Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers. They moved to New York, where Ferguson branched off on his own, getting a gig at the nightclub Baby Grand Club in Harlem, billed as &quot;The Cobra Kid.&quot;[1]\n\nHis 1951-1952 recording contract with Savoy Records produced some of his best recordings. Drummer, Jack &quot;The Bear&quot; Parker, who played on the Savoy dates, allegedly bestowed the singer with his explosive moniker. Other accounts credit Savoy record producer, Lee Magid, with coining H-Bomb's handle; either way, his dynamite vocals fulfilled the billing.[1] However, it was not until 1955 that rock and roll became a sensation, when Bill Haley &amp; His Comets' version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; became a hit.\n\nFerguson retired from touring in the early 1970s, but made a number of comebacks. Backed by the Medicine Men, he recorded his first album, Wiggin' Out, for Chicago's Earwig Records in 1993.[1] He died in 2006 at the Hospice of Cincinnati of complications from emphysema and cardiopulmonary disease.\n\n\n   1.
