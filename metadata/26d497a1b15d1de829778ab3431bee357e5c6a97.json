Cheiro the world famous seer tells you all,\nin this book, about thr secret power numbers, these Numbers can make \nyou predict your own future accurately. Learn, how by adopting a minor \nchange in your name you can turn your bad luck into profitable gains. \nNumbers of Names - Dates - Health - Diseases - Herbs - Colours - \nCities - Racing &amp; Mystery.\n\n-Ellis Taylor &quot;Esoteric Alphabet&quot;\n\nThis work will show that alphabets are intentionally designed\nmulti-layered esoteric affairs and that the modern English\nalphabet is unequivocally, in my view, constructed according to\nthe King James Biblical Genesis Creation story. To help guard\nthe truth of what some ancient astrologer priests composed to\nteach and entertain initiates about the true nature of our lifejourney,\nthreats have been issued throughout the Bible, warning\nagainst using the means that were applied in its construction.\nThe Fishers of men control every aspect of communication, from\nthe media who cast the line to the tackle they use and the hook\nwe swallow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ baited with innocuous seeming morsels that we\ncall letters. It might surprise you but both the Bible and the\nalphabet are not only esoteric they are erotic! Like the most\nthrilling stories, it is full of sex, drugs and rock and roll Ã¢â‚¬â€œ By\nHeck Marge! Get that book from under that table leg!\n\n-Jean Baudrillard &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;\n\nSimulacra and Simulation is most known for its discussion of symbols, \nsigns, and how they relate to contemporaneity (simultaneous existences). \nBaudrillard claims that our current society has replaced all reality and \nmeaning with symbols and signs, and that human experience is of a simulation \nof reality. Moreover, these simulacra are not merely mediations of reality, \nnor even deceptive mediations of reality; they are not based in a reality \nnor do they hide a reality, they simply hide that anything like reality is \nirrelevant to our current understanding of our lives. The simulacra that \nBaudrillard refers to are the significations and symbolism of culture and \nmedia that construct perceived reality, the acquired understanding by which \nour lives and shared existence is and are rendered legible; Baudrillard \nbelieved that society has become so saturated with these simulacra and our \nlives so saturated with the constructs of society that all meaning was being \nrendered meaningless by being infinitely mutable. Baudrillard called this \nphenomenon the &quot;precession of simulacra&quot;.\n\n-Mark Booth &quot;Secret History of the World&quot;\n\nThey say that history is written by the victors. But what if history-or what \nwe come to know as history-has been written by the wrong people? What if \neverything we've been told is only part of the story?\n\nIn this groundbreaking and now famous work, Mark Booth embarks on an enthralling\ntour of our world's secret histories. Starting from a dangerous premise-that\neverything we've known about our world's past is corrupted, and that the \nstories put forward by the various cults and mystery schools throughout \nhistory are true-Booth produces nothing short of an alternate history of the \npast 3,000 years.\n\nFrom Greek and Egyptian mythology to Jewish folklore, from Christian cults to \nFreemasons, from Charlemagne to Don Quixote, from George Washington to Hitler- \nBooth shows that history needs a revolutionary rethink, and he has 3,000 years \nof hidden wisdom to back it up.\n\n-Michael Drosnin &quot;The Bible Code&quot;\n\n0n September 1, 1994, I flew to Israel and met in Jerusalem with a close friend \nof Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the poet Chaim Guri. I gave him a letter which \nhe immediately gave to the Prime Minister.\n&quot;An Israeli mathematician has discovered a hidden code in the Bible that appears \nto reveal the details of events that took place thousands of years after the \nBible was written,&quot; my letter to Rabin stated.\n\n&quot;The reason I'm telling you about this is that the only time your full name Yitzhak \nRabin is encoded in the Bible, the words 'assassin that will assassinate' cross \nyour name.&quot;\n\nOn November 4, 1995, came the awful confirmation, a shot in the back from a man \nwho believed he was on a mission from God, the murder that was encoded in the Bible\nthree thousand years ago.\n\n-Richard Cavendish &quot;The Black Arts&quot;\n\nThis book describes in detail the practice, theory, and underlying rationale of \nblack magic in all its branches - the summoning and control of evil spirits, \nnecromancy, psychic attack, Devil worship, witchcraft, the Black Mass, evil \ncharms and spells - as well as other branches of occult theory - numerology, \nastrology, alchemy, the Cabala, the tarot. Ancient black magic, the beliefs \nand practices of the great black magicians of the past 150 years, and the theories \nof cabalists, astrologers, and numerologists of the present day are all fully\ncovered in this book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d497a1b15d1de829778ab3431bee357e5c6a97","amp;dn":"Occult+Books+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d497a1b15d1de829778ab3431bee357e5c6a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,212,151,161,177,93,29,232,41,119,138,179,67,27,238,53,126,92,106,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
