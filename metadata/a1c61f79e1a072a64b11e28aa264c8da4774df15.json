Again.\n\nNo matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAs Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. &quot;I nearly missed you, Doctor August,&quot; she says. &quot;I need to send a message.&quot;\n\nThis is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.\n\n**\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nStarred Review Harry August isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t human. Well, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite accurate. He is human but a different sort of human from the rest of us: he was born (in the ladiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ washroom of a train station in England in 1919), he lives a certain number of years, and he diesÃ¢â‚¬â€and then heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s born again, right back where he started, and a handful of years later his memories of his first life return. Harry is, like a few others, a kalachakra, an immortal who is constantly reborn, each time with all the memories of his previous lives. This wonderful novel, narrated by Harry, ranges back and forth in time as he recounts episodes from his various lives, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all held together by a compelling mystery involving nothing less than the end of the world itself (a thousand years in the future). Beautifully written and structured, the book should be a big hit with SF fans. The pseudonymous authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name is being kept secret, but fans of SF and fantasy authors China Mieville, Christopher Priest, and Adam Roberts might note a stylistic similarity, especially in the novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant prose. Whoever Claire North turns out to be, he or she has written a remarkable book. --David Pitt\n\nReview\n\n&quot;An astonishing re-invention of the time travel narrative. Bold, magical and masterful.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Mike Carey\n\n&quot;Wonderful novel... held together by a compelling mystery involving nothing less than the end of the world itself. Beautifully written and structured...a remarkable book.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist (Starred Review)\n\n&quot;Fantastic.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€*io9*\n\n&quot;A tremendously entertaining ride...
