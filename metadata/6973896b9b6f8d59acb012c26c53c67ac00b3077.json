ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too bad, since it always means the title character is about to be put through the ringer. And she has to go through these trials and tribulations alone, because Bigby is off learning to drive (which leads to its own harrowing implications). But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made of pretty stern stuff, our Snow, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been a wilting flower in the face of adversity, so letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s see what sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made of.\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners!\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6973896b9b6f8d59acb012c26c53c67ac00b3077","amp;dn":"Fables+%23125","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6973896b9b6f8d59acb012c26c53c67ac00b3077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,115,137,107,155,111,141,89,172,176,18,194,108,83,198,122,192,11,48,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
