Read by David John.\n\n\nTen years after a massive oil crisis, the world lies devastated. The towns and cities of Britain are skeletal ghosts and very few humans have managed to survive. But sitting quietly amidst the ravaged landscapes are a few communities that have managed to fashion a new way of living. Jenny Sutherland leads one of these groups. Based on a series of decaying offshore oil-rigs, she has helped a few hundred people rebuild a semblance of normality. But as JennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people begin to explore their surroundings after a decade in the wilderness, they start to realise that not every survivor shares the same vision of a better future. Conflict is coming, and the stakes are higher than anyone could have imaginedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n\n\n&gt;--- This Audiobook was converted and uploaded by OldScotsman ---&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d998994855aa24dd6c8b9bd9fba35cfdb548c62","amp;dn":"Alex+Scarrow+-+Afterlight+%28Last+Light+book+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d998994855aa24dd6c8b9bd9fba35cfdb548c62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,153,137,148,133,90,162,77,214,200,185,189,159,186,53,207,219,84,140,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
