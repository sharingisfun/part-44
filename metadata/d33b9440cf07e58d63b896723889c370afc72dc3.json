Rabbit owners expect and deserve the same standard of veterinary care for their rabbits as they receive for their cats and dogs. Devoted entirely to the pet rabbit, this book is a practical and concise guide to health, husbandry and diseases.\n\nThe book begins with an overview of rabbit husbandry. Nutritional requirements and clinical examination are covered in chapters 2 and 3. Subsequent chapters then take a body system approach to describing diseases, their diagnosis and treatment. There are separate chapters on behaviour, anaesthesia and surgery, and zoonotic aspects.\n\nThis practical, quick-reference guide will appeal to veterinarians, veterinary students, veterinary nurses and breeders alike.\n\nRabbits: Health, Husbandry and Diseases\nBy Virginia Richardson, Jacques Rivoirard\nPublished by Blackwell Science, 2000\nISBN 063205221X, 9780632052219\n178 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33b9440cf07e58d63b896723889c370afc72dc3","amp;dn":"Rabbits+-+Health%2C+Husbandry+and+Diseases","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33b9440cf07e58d63b896723889c370afc72dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,59,148,64,207,7,229,141,99,184,150,114,56,137,195,112,175,199,45,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
