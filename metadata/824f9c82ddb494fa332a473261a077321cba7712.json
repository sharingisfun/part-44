The \n  story begins in our world - the &quot;real world&quot; - where we here at \n  Interdimensional Games have developed a satellite (iDGi-1) capable of \n  opening a digital rift through time and space... \n\n  Anyone with an internet connection can travel through this rift and awaken \n  within an alternate dimension from our own - the &quot;game world&quot; - in the \n  year 2042.     \n\n  Features:\n\n  * Considered the first of three planned games, each containing their own \n    fully resolvable story arcs but linked by the concept and a much larger \n    design to the story and its countless mysteries. \n  * Immerse yourself into the complete interactive story of what happens aboard \n    the C-3800-D &quot;ZENLIL&quot; Consortium Command vessel on December 21st, 2042... \n  * Built with a modified version of the SOURCE engine, explore ZENLIL, a \n    living and highly interactive environment with complete freedom and agency. \n    Includes turbulence and non-scripted decompression events! \n  * Engage with a cast of over 20 people with an innovative and life like \n    conversation system with over 4,000 lines of fully voiced dialogue. OR... \n    don't engage with them at all and choose to never speak a word! \n  * Experience an all original orchestral score by award winning composer Jeremy \n    Soule \n  * Engage in a deep mystery concerning an on-board murder and a large band of \n    mercenaries who seem to want YOU dead. \n  * Dive into a world with well over 150,000 words of back-story and lore, where \n    everything you read, see, speak, or hear relates to the story and characters, \n    and everything is there for a reason. \n  * A highly original energy based inventory system with original sci-fi weapons, \n    gadgets and armor. \n  * The story unfolds based largely on your actions. You may use diplomacy and \n    talk your way through the entire game - never shooting anyone! OR, decide to \n    use deadly or non-lethal force. \n  * Forge lasting relationships with the crew of ZENLIL, and alter the course of \n    the story through your actions. Your choices will change your play \n    experience, and subsequent playthroughs offer the chance to make different \n    decisions and see all new outcomes. \n  * Regardless of what you choose to do or not, the experience always moves \n    forward, adapting seamlessly to YOU.                                                           \n\n  \n             ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸   Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ Ã‚Â²   Ã‚Â²   ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ“ Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ¸\n  ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º  Ã‚Â² ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º  ÃƒÅ“ Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â² Ãƒâ€º   Ãƒâ€º   Ãƒâ€º  Ã‚Â² Ãƒâ€º  Ã‚Â² Ãƒâ€º  ÃƒÅ“ Ã‚Â²ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n             ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸     ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸   ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸    ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸     ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸   ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ¸ÃƒÅ¸\n\n   1.
