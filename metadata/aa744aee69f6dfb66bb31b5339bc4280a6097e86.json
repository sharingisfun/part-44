In a genre often seen as somewhat dull and with very\nlittle variation, 02 manages to bring South American Delta Blues to a\nwhole new fan base, and ultimately a whole new generation.\n\n02 is filled with all the emotion you would expect from a traditional blues\nrecord. You can feel the passion through every note of his harmonica, and\nthe groove seeps through with consummate ease. In this respect, Darvill\nmaintains all his roots in raw, low-down rhythm and blues.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa744aee69f6dfb66bb31b5339bc4280a6097e86","amp;dn":"Son+of+Dave+-+02+%28192+kbps+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa744aee69f6dfb66bb31b5339bc4280a6097e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,116,74,238,105,246,223,182,107,179,27,83,57,188,66,128,166,9,126,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
