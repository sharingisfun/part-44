See also Steve Sekely's The Scar, which I will also be uploading. It is a much better movie by all accounts, but Waterfront isn't too bad.\n\n******************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed85dea9bc0549a0e3abc5c66b8b60f97c40a21","amp;dn":"Waterfront+%281944+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed85dea9bc0549a0e3abc5c66b8b60f97c40a21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,216,93,234,155,192,84,154,14,58,188,92,102,184,182,15,151,196,10,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
