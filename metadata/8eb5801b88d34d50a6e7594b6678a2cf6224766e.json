Extreme configurability, performance and a top-notch user and developer community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.\nThanks to a technology called Portage, Gentoo can become an ideal secure server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system, embedded solution or something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of its near-unlimited adaptability, we call Gentoo a metadistribution.\nOf course, Gentoo is more than just the software it provides. It is a community built around a distribution which is driven by more than 300 developers and thousands of users. The distribution project provides the means for the users to enjoy Gentoo: documentation, infrastructure (mailinglists, site, forums ...), release engineering, software porting, quality assurance, security followup, hardening and more.\nTo advise on and help with Gentoo's global development, a 7-member council is elected on a yearly basis which decides on global issues, policies and advancements in the Gentoo project. \n\n'The future is now' edition\n\nGentoo Linux is proud to announce the availability of a new LiveDVD to celebrate the continued collaboration between Gentoo users and developers.

The livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-11.2 version will work on 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64. If your CPU architecture is x86, then boot with the default gentoo kernel. If your arch is amd64, boot with the gentoo64 kernel. This means you can boot a 64-bit kernel and install a customized 64-bit userland while using the provided 32-bit userland. The livedvd-amd64-multilib-11.2 version is for x86_64 only.\nPlease select your architecture to be redirected to a mirror for download:\n\nx86\namd64\nTorrents are available at http://torrents.gentoo.org\n\nIf you need support or have any questions, please visit the discussion thread on our forum.\n\nThank you for your continued support,\nGentoo Linux Developers, the Gentoo Foundation, and the Gentoo-Ten Project.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gentoo.org/main/en/about.xml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gentoo.org/main/en/about.xml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nchecksums : http://gentoo.mirrors.tds.net/pub/gentoo//releases/amd64/11.2/livedvd-amd64-multilib-11.2.iso.DIGESTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb5801b88d34d50a6e7594b6678a2cf6224766e","amp;dn":"livedvd-amd64-multilib-11.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb5801b88d34d50a6e7594b6678a2cf6224766e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,181,128,27,136,211,77,80,166,231,89,75,102,120,162,207,98,36,118,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
