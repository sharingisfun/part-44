Howe reveals that the crowd is more than wise - it's talented, creative, and stunningly productive.\n\nCrowdsourcing activates the transformative power of today's technology, liberating the latent potential within us all. It's a perfect meritocracy, where age, gender, race, education, and job history no longer matter; the quality of work is all that counts; and every field is open to people of every imaginable background. If you can perform the service, design the product, or solve the problem, you've got the job.\n\n(C)2008 Jeff Howe; (P)2008 Random House, Inc.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cd454c054612d4efc65a5f6e9c774ea20655eef","amp;dn":"Crowdsourcing%3A+The+Coming+Big+Bang+of+Busines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cd454c054612d4efc65a5f6e9c774ea20655eef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,212,84,192,84,97,45,78,252,101,165,246,233,199,116,234,32,101,94,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
