I hate those people.  I looked high and low to find these and make them freely available. The copyright is dead on these, but I don\\&amp;#039;t understand the OTR community and why they find the need to sell stuff that is free.  I would understand if these people were only the people that originally sourced the material.  But it\\&amp;#039;s not... it\\&amp;#039;s 99% people that downloaded it from the net.  Screw you guys... \n \nFree the OTR!!  Please distribute freely and reseed!\n\nX Minus One is a great sci-fi series.  I think some of the \\&quot;remakes\\&quot; are just copies in here so please excuse that, but otherwise this is the complete series.  For a couple of them  (Embassy), someone has spliced on the X Minus One opening to the old Dimension X production.  I\\&amp;#039;ve included these just for curiosity\\&amp;#039;s sake.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efddf36824f769e13a7c9fd7e36521fcfbe54e47","amp;dn":"X+Minus+One+series+-+Old+Time+Radio+-+OTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efddf36824f769e13a7c9fd7e36521fcfbe54e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,221,243,104,36,247,105,225,58,124,159,215,227,101,33,252,251,229,78,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
