Edited, with an introduction, by Guy G. Stroumsa.\n\nISBN: 9789004168398 | xxiv, 204 pages | PDF\n\n\nThe American historian of ancient religions, Morton Smith (1915-1991), studied with the great scholar of Jewish mysticism, Gershom Scholem (1897-1982), when he was in Jerusalem during the Second World War. After the war, the two started a long, fascinating and at times intense correspondence that ended only with Scholem's death. \n\nThese letters, found in the Scholem archive in the National Library in Jerusalem, provide a rare perspective on the world and the approach of two leading historians of religion in the twentieth century. They also shed important new light upon Smith's discovery of a letter attributed to Clement of Alexandria referring to a secret Gospel of Mark.\n\n(For those among us who can never have enough Scholem!)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee2e3e331f1e82debca56594fa9bf5afc39be2e","amp;dn":"Gershom+Scholem+and+Morton+Smith%2C+Correspondence+1945-1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee2e3e331f1e82debca56594fa9bf5afc39be2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,226,227,227,49,241,232,45,235,202,86,89,79,169,191,90,252,57,190,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
