Then the comics were\nsorted into Carl Barks library sets. Mostly.\n\nYou can see which comics would be good for scanlation in the \nrequest list that has a star next to the story.\n\nI still need to go through Set 9 and 10 to confirm\nwhich European DD comics would be suitable for scanlation.\nThe CBDA comics scan request list will be updated as I go \nalong.\n\nIt's a big project for me just to do one comic.\nSo, if someone would like to do one, then post a message and\nthen a download link when ready. Thanks!\n\n\n\nSet 9 will be ready in 2-3 weeks.\n\n*************\n\nI am still putting together set 6,9-12.\n\nI found 20 HQ comics in Italian for Set 9.\nThen I found 50 HQ comics in German, which has comics\nfor Set 9, 10 and other stories.\nSo, if I can't find an english HQ comic for Set 9,\nthen I have the option to do a scanlation.\n\n1 page scanlated takes me 20-30 minutes!\nThe titles and sound effects words take the most time.\n(Tekton pro ex and Tahoma (italic), 20 pts, bold)\n\nI'm not sure if I can find the patience to do any of the\nlonger stories such as Rug Riders or Luck of the North.\n\nMaybe a group scanlating project?\nI can upload an organized un-scanlated italian and \ngerman DD comics, if anybody's interested.\nI'm hoping that more recent english scans show\nup though.\n\n\nIf I get any longer stories scanlated, then\nI will include them in the final CBDA complete set gigatorrent\n\nSet 11:\n\na.

It gives me a quite a few more comics\nto update though.\n\nThe CBDA collection will be complete, \nbut if you can find better scans than posted within this \ncollection, then please leave a message and post up your comic scans.\n\nI will update this request list as I go along.\nThanks for helping!\n\n*******************************************\nScan Request of more recent colored published issues:\n\n*******************************************\n\n(Gold Key comics are not as good as original Dell comic.)\n\n* = german, italian comics available for scanlation\n\nSet 1:\n\nDD 4c0108 Seals are so Smart\nDD 4c0189 The Old Castle's Secret *\n\nSet 2:\n\nDD 4c0238 Voodoo Hoodoo (censored version), \nSlippery shine\nDD 4c0256 Luck of the North *\nDD 4c0263 A fetching price\nDD 4c0318 No Such Varmint *\nDD 4c0367 Treeing off\nDD 4c0422 Stable prices\nDD 045 Power plowing, Courtside heating\nDD 051 All season hat\nDD 079 Poor Loser\nDD 138 A Day in a Duck's Life\n(Daan Jippes)\n\nSet 3:\n\nUS 4c0386 Soupline eight\nUS 4c0456 Somethin' fishy here *\nUS 005 Hospitality week\nUS 006 Dig it \nUS 007 Temper tampering\nUS 008 Campaign of Note\nUS 009 Ski lift letdown, Cast of Thousands\nUS 012 A sweat deal\nUS 013 Art of security\nUS 014 Fireflies are free\nUS 015 Buffo or bust\nUS 016 Fertile assets, Backyard bonanaza\nUS 017 China shop shakeup, Early to build\nUS 018 Net worth, Relative reaction\n\nSet 4:\n\nUS 021 Getting Thor, Dogged determination\nUS 022 Going to pieces, That sinking feeling\nUS 023 US and the fabulous tycoon *, All choked up\nUS 025 Bill wind, News from afar\nUS 027 Firefly tracker *, US crawls for cash \nUS 028 The money hat\nUS 030 Pipeline to danger *, War paint\nUS 031 All at sea, The balmy Swami, \nThe secret book\nUS 033 Thumbs up, The big bobber, \nBongo on the Congo (censored) *\nUS 035 The golden nugget boat *\nUS 036 The moneybag goat *\nUS 038 Unsafe safe, Playmates, \nMonkey business, Collection Day\nUS 039 Art Appreciation\nUS 042 Dueling Tycoons\nUS 043 For old dime's sake\nWDCS 262 Rags to Riches\n\nSet 5:\n\nUS 047 No bargain, Up and at it\nUS 048 The Many faces of Magica DeSpell *\nUS 049 Loony Lunar Gold Rush *\nUS 050 Rug Riders in the Sky *\nUS 055 Ticking detector\nUS 057 Plummeting with precision, Snake Take\nUS 058 Laundry for less\nUS 061 So far and no safari, Down for the count, \nTop wages, It happened one winter\nUS 071 King Scrooge the First \n(Daan Jippes)\n\n\nSet 6:\n\n4c1025 Trail tycoon\n4c1150 Daisy Duck: Small fryers, The inventive gentleman, Undercover girl\n4c1055 Daisy Duck: The New girl, Tight shoes\n4c1161 Grandma Duck\n4c1073 Grandma Duck: Mopping up\n4c1095 Gyro Gearloose: His shining hour\n4c1184 Gyro Gearloose: Mechanized mess, The old timer\nDBP 01 Forbidium Money Bin\nDD tells about kites\nHDL Woodchucks: 6,7,9,16,19,21,23,25\n(Daan Jippes)\n\nSet 7:\n\nWDCS 034 Good deeds *\nWDCS 074 The tax collectors\nWDCS 094 Donald of the Coast Guard\n\nSet 8:\n\nWDCS 097 Pearls of wisdom\nWDCS 101 DD's Worst Nightmare\nWDCS 108 The great Duckburg frog jumping contest\n\nSet 9:\n\nWDCS 187 Searching for a successor *\nWDCS 190 In the Swim\nWDCS 192 The Master\nWDCS 193 A Whale of a Story *\nWDCS 196 Statues of Limitations *\nWDCS 199 Gyro's Imagination Invention *\nWDCS 204 Losing Face *\nWDCS 210 The Half-Baked Baker *\nWDCS 221 Tracking Sandy\nWDCS 222 Master mover *\nWDCS 223 Spring Fever *\nWDCS 224 The Beachcombers' Picnic *\nWDCS 227 The Black Forest rescue *\nWDCS 229 The Good Deeds \n\nSet 10:\n\nWDCS 259 Jungle Bungle\n\nSet 11:\n\nPluto saves the ship 1942 *\n\n4c0076 Andy Panda The widow's doughnuts 1943\n\nOur Gang:\nBarney Bear and Benny Burro \n08 With a little help to my friends 1943\n09 Playful mountain goat 1944\n11 Happy Hound: Mother is a wolf's best friend 1944\n15 How to be a matador 1944\n16 Cougar, cougar shining bright 1945\n18 Serenade for senorita 1945\n19 Snap goes the turtle 1945\n23 The sounds of silence 1946\n25 The mastery of archery 1946\n26 The compleat angler 1946\n27 The dauntless dogcatchers 1946\n28 Modern art, and all that 1946\n29 Somewhere under the rainbow 1946\n30 A hole in one 1946\n31 Ol' McElk, he had a farm 1947\n32 Klipto Kleppo strikes again 1947\n33 Uncle Grizzly 1947 \n34 Home, sweet home no more 1947\n35 Riches, riches in the wall 1947\n\nSet 12:\n\nSomewhere beyond Nowhere\n(Daan Jippes)\n\n******************\nVideo VHS Request:\n******************\n\n01.
