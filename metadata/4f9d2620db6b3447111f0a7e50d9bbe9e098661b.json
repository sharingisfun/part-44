This Ralf Scheepers-led \nproject (along with Matt Sinner of Sinner) is a mix of many \nstyles-- 'Painkiller'-era Priest (with the distortion clarity of \n\n'Defenders' and muscle of 'Jugulator'); the heavy precision of \n\nRage; and the melodies and inventiveness of a heavier Gamma Ray \n\nor Helloween. Makes sense, though, as Scheepers and guest \n\nguitarist Kai Hansen have pulled stints with some of the above.\nShowcased are massive double-bass drums, solos that soar, \nsplendid guitar fills, harmonics and pull-offs, and Scheepers at \n\nhis vocal Halford-esque best.\n&quot;Chainbreaker&quot; is a sharp and brutal opener, with an angry and \n\npowerful chorus. A bludgeoning main riff and soaring chorus \n\nvocals bolster &quot;Promised Land,&quot; and the heaviness is matched in \n\n&quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot;.\n&quot;Formula One&quot; starts out with a high-pitched engine along with \n\nScheepers, before a face-smashing guitar crunch descends... \nExcellent melodic work in the solo and latter stages of the song, \n\nand heavy post chorus and verse work!\n&quot;Dollars&quot; is a tremendous power groove mover... Concrete, \nmethodical, and mesmerizing. Check out the double-time riffs in \n\nthe verses!\n&quot;Battalions of Hate&quot; and &quot;Running in the Dust&quot; are simply \nsuperb---perhaps the top two songs on the disc. The first \nfeatures biting guitar fills in the second verses, a bruising \n\nchorus, and Ralf getting up! The latter is pure head-moving \n\npower, with caustic stop-and-go pulls in the verses. The \n\npost-chorus procession is a tremendous melodic movement, ala a \n\nvery heavy Helloween, which rolls around the 3:05 mark. \n\nExcellent.\nBoth &quot;Nine Lives&quot; and &quot;Thunderdome&quot; are fast and heavy, though \n\ninevitably will be slightly overshadowed on this opus of gems. \n\nAnd that, my friends, is a compliment.[/quote]\n\n[color=darkred]Enjoy &amp; Seed[/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f9d2620db6b3447111f0a7e50d9bbe9e098661b","amp;dn":"Primal+Fear+-+Primal+Fear%5BPower%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f9d2620db6b3447111f0a7e50d9bbe9e098661b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,157,38,32,219,107,52,71,17,31,10,126,80,217,187,233,224,152,102,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
