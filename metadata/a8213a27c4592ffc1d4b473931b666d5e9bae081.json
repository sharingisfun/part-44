In this incisive new book, the man that has been called &quot;the only one to understand the mind of the jihadist&quot; shows that the most important battle is actually taking place in the hearts and minds of the world's population. This is the war of ideas, where ideology is the most powerful weapon of all.\n\nPhares explores the beliefs of two opposing camps, one standing for democracy and human rights, and the other rejecting the idea of an international community and calling for jihad against the West. He reveals the strategies of both sides, explaining that new technologies and the growing media savvy of the jihadists have raised the stakes in the conflict. And most urgently, he warns that the West is in danger of losing the war, for whereas debate and theorizing rarely translate into action here, ideas and deeds are inextricably linked for the forces of jihad.\n\nAuthor: Walid Phares\nPublisher: Pocket Books\nPublication Date: December 7, 2010\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8213a27c4592ffc1d4b473931b666d5e9bae081","amp;dn":"Walid+Phares+-+The+War+of+Ideas+%5BJihad+vs.+Democracy%5D+%28mobi%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8213a27c4592ffc1d4b473931b666d5e9bae081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,33,58,39,196,89,47,252,29,75,71,57,49,182,102,213,233,186,224,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
