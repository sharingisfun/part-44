Stranded on a Welsh farm they  \n                    are offered sanctuary by a mysterious woman,  \n                    Hazel. But things soon turn sour when news  \n                    reaches them that they are now the prime  \n                    suspects for Bonehead's murder. Back home, Liam  \n                    and Maxine seem to be the only ones concerned  \n                    by their disappearance which forces Ian to  \n                    confront Jimmy, the real murderer, in order to  \n                    establish the truth. Elsewhere, Micky and Liam  \n                    have been picked by the local council to make a  \n                    community film in the hope it will inspire the  \n                    residents of Chatsworth now that their estate  \n                    has been identified as the most run down in  \n                    Britain. With Kelly and Shane's help Micky  \n                    decides to stretch poetic licence in pursuit of  \n                    glory, whilst Liam uses the competition as a  \n                    cover to film evidence that could save Carl and  \n                    Chesney from prison.                     \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d97e3ae486c6eb32608466d4a37f13ee968f9a38","amp;dn":"Shameless.S07E09.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d97e3ae486c6eb32608466d4a37f13ee968f9a38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,126,58,228,134,198,235,50,96,132,102,212,163,127,19,238,150,143,154,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
