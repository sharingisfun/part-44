It was recorded for\r\nthe MTV Unplugged series and includes both the hit song &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and a\r\nheavily reworked acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot;. The album won three Grammy Awards\r\nin 1993 and sold 26 million copies worldwide..\r\n\r\nClapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray\r\nFilm Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the\r\nperformance included early versions of &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus Left Town&quot;\r\nalong with &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and a version of &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot;. Clapton\r\nplayed Martin 000-42 acoustic guitars for much of the performance, and in 2004, one\r\nof the guitars sold for 791,500 USD (Â£ 434.400) in auction. Commenting on the\r\npopularity of the album in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wishes the reader to\r\nunderstand the great emotional toll he experienced around that time, and suggests\r\nthat they visit the grave of his son Conor in Ripley to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - Signe [03:14]\r\n02 - Before You Accuse Me [03:44]\r\n03 - Hey Hey [03:16]\r\n04 - Tears In Heaven [04:36]\r\n05 - Lonely Stranger [05:27]\r\n06 - Nobody Knows You When You're Down &amp; Out [03:49]\r\n07 - Layla [04:46]\r\n08 - Running On Faith [06:29]\r\n09 - Walkin' Blues [03:37]\r\n10 - Alberta [03:42]\r\n11 - San Francisco Bay Blues [03:23]\r\n12 - Malted Milk [03:36]\r\n13 - Old Love [07:53]\r\n14 - Rollin' &amp; Tumblin' [04:11]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Eric Clapton\r\nGenre: Acoustic rock / Acoustic blues\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1992\r\nLabel: Reprise Records\r\nBarcode: 9362-45024-2\r\nNumber of Tracks:14\r\nTotal Duration: 1:01:47.307\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 865 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags : VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor : Mp3tag v2.58\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 383 MB (401,124,810 bytes)\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68a8a781dc9087ccf867d77da600a685fbf2e62","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Unplugged+%5B1992%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68a8a781dc9087ccf867d77da600a685fbf2e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,138,138,120,29,201,8,124,207,134,125,119,218,96,10,104,95,191,46,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
