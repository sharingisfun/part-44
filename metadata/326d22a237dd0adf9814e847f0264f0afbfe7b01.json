Nabokov's protagonist, Smurov, is a lovelorn, excruciatingly self-conscious Russian ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© living in prewar Berlin, who commits suicide after being humiliated by a jealous husband, only to suffer even greater indignities in the afterlife.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326d22a237dd0adf9814e847f0264f0afbfe7b01","amp;dn":"THE+EYE+-+Vladimir+Nabokov+%28Lolita+author%29+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326d22a237dd0adf9814e847f0264f0afbfe7b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,109,34,162,55,221,10,223,152,20,232,71,240,38,79,10,251,254,123,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
