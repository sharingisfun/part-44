Updates are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the driver or update from being reinstalled, a Show or hide updates troubleshooter from Microsoft is available that provides a user interface for hiding and showing Windows Updates and drivers for Windows 10. Wushowhide is an official tool from Microsoft\r\n\r\n\r\nWHDownloader, formerly called the Windows Hotfix Downloader, is a lightweight and easy to use downloader used for finding and applying the latest Microsoft Windows updates voor Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2016 (Office 365). \r\n\r\n\r\nA powerful alternative to WHDownloader is WSUS Offline Update v10.1 which does the same job but offers more options. One major advantage of WSUS Offline Update is that it does not rely on handcrafted lists of available updates and therefore is automatically up to date. Using &quot;WSUS Offline Update&quot;, you can update any computer running Microsoft Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2016 (Office 365) safely, quickly and without an Internet connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe official AMD Driver Autodetect tool is designed to detect the model of graphics card and version of operating system installed in your computer. Our Autodetect tool can only be used on systems running the MicrosoftÂ® Windows 10 operating system and/or AMD Radeonâ„¢ graphics. It does not work on LinuxÂ® systems, Apple Boot Camp systems or AMD FireProâ„¢ graphics products. \r\n\r\nIf a new driver is available, the tool is designed to help you download it. After you download the driver, simply click â€œInstallâ€ to start your installation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeForce Experience automatically notifies you of new driver releases from NVIDIA. With a single click, you can update the driver directly, without leaving your desktop. The easiest way to update your drivers, optimize your games, and share your victories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IntelÂ® Driver Update Utility keeps your Windows 10 system up-to-date. It detects which driver updates are relevant to your computer, and then helps you install them quickly and easily","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5895c02d1f786417c3fb0d6ad69c331320f6b510","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Update+Tools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5895c02d1f786417c3fb0d6ad69c331320f6b510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,149,192,45,31,120,100,23,195,251,13,106,214,156,51,19,32,246,181,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
