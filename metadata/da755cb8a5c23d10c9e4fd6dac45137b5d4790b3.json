It is an absolutely convincing portrayal of a marriage that, although between two people who found most of their sexual release in homosexual contacts, was a loving partnership that far surpassed many conventional marriages. Janet McTeer is, of course, amazing and the scene between her and Cathryn Harrison (who plays Violet) when their relationship dissolves due to Violet&amp;#039;s impending marriage is heart-breaking.\n\nWell worth watching - a very interesting story of an unconventional relationship.&quot;\n\n\nNO SUBS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da755cb8a5c23d10c9e4fd6dac45137b5d4790b3","amp;dn":"Portrait+of+a+Marriage++%28+Lesbian+Interest+-+BBC+Prod.+1990+%29+Di","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da755cb8a5c23d10c9e4fd6dac45137b5d4790b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,117,92,184,165,194,61,16,201,228,253,109,172,69,19,123,93,71,144,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
