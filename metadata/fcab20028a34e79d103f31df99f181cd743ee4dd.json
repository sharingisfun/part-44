And this privileged apprenticeship had always demanded patience, perseverance and true grit.\n\nIn Kung Fu Kitchen, the rules are broken. Culinary apprentices are plucked from their comfort zones and thrown into the depths of the gastronomical unknown. These extra-ordinary kitchen skills scream out for physical strength, agility and dexterity.\n\nGiven just days to perfect what many have taken a life time to master. Catch culinary miracles in the making inÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Kung Fu Kitchen.\n\nKung Fu Kitchen is a six-part action-packed culinary adventure series that delves into the highly-disciplined cooking techniques in some of Asia's best known specialties. From the high jinks of knife juggling in Japanese teppanyaki to the contorting acrobatics of Kungfu tea in China, they are stretched to their limits under the exacting standards of their 'Kung Fu' masters. The result is entertaining, adrenaline pumping, but honest and unpredictable television.\n\n\n\n\nKung Fu Kitchen - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\nKung Fu Tea (Hangzhou, China)\n\nThe art of serving Kungfu Tea is a visual spectacle that incorporates a long spouted brass kettle and strong elements of martial arts in its acrobatic serving method. Add to the fact that the kettle contains piping hot water (making it difficult to handle) and that not a single drop is allowed to be spilled outside the teacup when serving customers; one can understand why it takes years to fully master the numerous Kungfu moves involved in pouring a simple cup of tea.\n\nWander into the backstreets of Hangzhou to discover how this particular long-spout pouring technique was born out of tea-brewing rigors and the influence of the Chinese literati and tea-house entertainment.\n\n\n\nRebroadcast Air Date: 30-Aug-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcab20028a34e79d103f31df99f181cd743ee4dd","amp;dn":"Kung.Fu.Kitchen.S01E01.PDTV.x264-SammY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcab20028a34e79d103f31df99f181cd743ee4dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,171,32,2,138,52,231,157,16,63,49,223,153,241,129,205,116,62,228,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
