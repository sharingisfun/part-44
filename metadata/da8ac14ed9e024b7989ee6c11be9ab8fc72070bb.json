FATAL (which some people simply call &quot;the game that must not be named&quot;) was spawned from the twisted mind of Byron Hall and is renowned for its lousy rules, biased perspective (to say the least), and pathetic writing style. I refuse to describe this game other than to say it is horrible and that it must be read to understand just how horrible it is. \n\nIf you'd like I'll start tracking down other horrible RPGs and make another torrent, but my sanity has already taken such a hit from this one that I might just turn into a drooling Chaos Spawn if I hunt down any more.\n\nFile List: \n\nA. Books;\n\n1. Fantasy_Adventure_To_Adult_Lechery.pdf (the origional &quot;beta version&quot;)  \n\n2. From_Another_Time_Another_Land.pdf (the &quot;clean version&quot; [yeah right] released after the original) \n\n3. Grimoirium_Genitoris.pdf (Book of The Gods [note this book was never completed, this is what does exist])\n\n4. Grimoirium_Monstrum.pdf (Book of Monsters) \n\n5. Talitaria.pdf (Campaign setting)\n\nB. Extras;\n\n1. Fatal_Theme_Song.mp3 (exactly what it sounds like, and it sounds bad)\n\n2. Useful Links.txt (A selection of URL's for reviews and other FATAL related information)\n\nC. Programs; *note* These programs may be too old to run on modern computers. I can't get them to work, but I include them for completeness\n\n1. DISPOSIT.exe (Disposition test)\n\n2. DispositionReadMe.txt\n\n3. DispositionResultsKey.txt\n\n4. TEMPERAM.EXE (Temperment test)\n\n5. TemperamentReadMe.txt\n\n\nP.S.
