Lovecraft\n\nActor, journalist , devotee of Celtic Christianity and the Holy Grail legend, Welshman Arthur Machen is considered one of the fathers of weird fiction, a master of mayhem whose work has drawn comparisons to H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. \n\nReaders will find the perfect introduction to his style in this new collection. With the title story, an exercise in the bizarre that leaves the reader disoriented virtually from the first page, Machen turns even fundamental truths upside down.\n\nGenre: Horror, Werird Fiction\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9862b78a8ef0b960a243aecc344aa5e8dc37a3f","amp;dn":"The+White+People+And+Other+Weird+Stories+by+Arthur+Machen+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9862b78a8ef0b960a243aecc344aa5e8dc37a3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,134,43,120,168,239,11,150,10,36,58,236,195,68,170,94,141,195,122,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
