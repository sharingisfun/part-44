They're informed by former cohorts Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett that Maid Marian now lives at the nearby priory, where she has become an abbess. Marian greets Robin's return with mixed feelings, but after he rescues her from his longtime enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham, who tries to arrest her on religious grounds, the two become lovers once again.\n\n\tSean Connery\t... \tRobin Hood\n\tAudrey Hepburn\t... \tLady Marian\n\tRobert Shaw\t... \tSheriff of Nottingham\n\tRichard Harris\t... \tRichard the Lionheart\n\tNicol Williamson\t... \tLittle John\n\tDenholm Elliott\t... \tWill Scarlett\n\tKenneth Haigh\t... \tSir Ranulf\n\tRonnie Barker\t... \tFriar Tuck\n\tIan Holm\t... \tKing John\n\tBill Maynard\t... \tMercadier\n\tEsmond Knight\t... \tOld Defender\n\tVeronica Quilligan\t... \tSister Mary\n\tPeter Butterworth\t... \tSurgeon\n\tJohn Barrett\t... \tJack\n\tKenneth Cranham\t... \tJack's Apprentice\n\nDirector: Richard Lester\n\nRuntime: 106 mins\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075147/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075147/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCodecs: \n\n Video :  836 MB,  1139 Kbps,  25.0 fps,  584*320 (16:9),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4, \n Audio :  56 MB,  77 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  1 channels,  0x55 = Lame MP3,  CBR,\n\nAudio 1: Espanol\nAudio 2: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c9e2921ce8e650a1963b31c7f5f3d0266639cb","amp;dn":"Robin+and+Marian+%5B1976%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c9e2921ce8e650a1963b31c7f5f3d0266639cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,201,226,146,28,232,230,80,161,150,59,49,199,245,243,208,38,102,57,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
