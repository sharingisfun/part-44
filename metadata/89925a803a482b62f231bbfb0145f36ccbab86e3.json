We then think it made an appearance in the 1970s on Saturday morning television. According to the British Film Institute, it was made in in 1957 in East Germany and was show many times in the 60-70s on British TV. The Director was Francesco Stefani.\n\nAlthough it was originally filmed in German, it had a monologue English voice over when transmitted on British television. This remastered version has the audio track of the English 60s-70s version which was considered for a time to be lost somewhere in the archives.\n\nA lovely old fashioned fairy tale of good triumphing over evil.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nOk, you can hear the audio, but there&amp;#039;s no video to see? You need to download the correct codec.
