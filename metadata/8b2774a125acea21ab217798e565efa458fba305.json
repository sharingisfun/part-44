Nils Petter-Molvaer has been instrumental in creating new fusions between jazz and electronic music, and his debut album &amp;#039;Khmer&amp;#039; from 1997 did more than most to bring these two areas of music together.\n\n&amp;#039;Re-Vision&amp;#039; is a collection that is drawn from the music he has created for film soundtracks, and presents what NPM considers to be the most ÃƒÂ¢??independently listenableÃƒÂ¢?? tracks from these works.\n\nThe album, re-vision, draws from three different films: Frozen Heart (Dir. Stig Andersen); EDY (dir. StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phan GuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rin-TilliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©); Hoppet (Dir. Petter NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦ss). The moods on the tracks from these three films vary greatly, yet they form a unified vision.\n\n&amp;#039;Re-vision&amp;#039; is quite different from MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r&amp;#039;s other studio or live material, and it sits in stark contrast to the two previous &quot;Re-&quot; albums, Recoloured and Remakes: it is fluid and atmospheric, moving through textural changes, reloading itself with new emotional energies as it progresses, and yet sustains a unity and coherence, becoming something uniquely &quot;MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r&quot;. It stands as a complete MolvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦r album, expressing the unique musical vision that has informed his albums from &amp;#039;Khmer&amp;#039; to &amp;#039;ER&amp;#039;.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!
