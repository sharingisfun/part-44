Ryukyu Underground takes this principle one step further by using samples of original recording from local labels and transporting them into uncharted territory, creating dance, electronica, jungle, soul, jazz and hip-hop swim in the mix with elements of Indian, Afrobeat, and Japanese traditional music, to create a uniquely globed sound direct from the Ryukyu Underground.\n\nCD Has been ripped and compressed into a rar file with &quot;store&quot; settings for minimal data loss.\n\nEnjoy the CD\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:133601d55601636be94aba243be3bdb14a6ae5b7","amp;dn":"Ryakyu+Underground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"133601d55601636be94aba243be3bdb14a6ae5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,54,1,213,86,1,99,107,233,74,186,36,59,227,189,177,74,106,229,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
