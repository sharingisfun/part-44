The story begins in 2004, when a group of mercenaries, including a British ex-special forces officer named Simon Mann, is arrested in Zimbabwe. Equatorial GuineaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, accuses them of plotting a coup against him. When Mann is sentenced to 34 years in Equatorial GuineaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s notorious Black Beach prison, he claims to be only one piece of an international plot to control the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vast oil resources. Once Upon a Coup travels the globe to unravel that plot, which stretches from Africa to the U.K., from a prime ministerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son to Zimbabwean arms dealers, from South Africa to Spain.\n\nBut as this all plays out, another actor is bidding for a share of the oil: China. The Chinese government has showered the country with glittering new buildings and a new administrative capital. If President Obiang has grown skeptical of Western intentions, he has welcomed China as a new business partner. Starting with a small West African nation and stretching around the globe, Once Upon a Coup sheds light on the uncomfortable realities of oil politics in the 21st century.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 24s 818ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 004 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 135 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13beff08d8ade93a703916ef0baa37da16ba4219","amp;dn":"PBS+Wide+Angle-+Once+Upon+a+Coup+08.26.2009.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13beff08d8ade93a703916ef0baa37da16ba4219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,190,255,8,216,173,233,58,112,57,22,239,11,170,55,218,22,186,66,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
