More than 250 A-Z entries explore the people, crimes, investigations, and court cases behind 200 years of American political scandals. This unbiased volume also delves into the issues surrounding Koreagate, the Chinese money scandal, and other ethical lapses. Relevant terms and statutes, including the Independent Counsel Act and impeachment as a tool of political punishment, are examined as well.\n\nStudents and scholars following American history, political science, and ethics, plus other intrigued readers, will all appreciate this survey of a wide range of corrupting influences. This title focuses on how politicians of all stripes have fallen because of their greed and hubris. And how society has used electoral and judicial means against those who tested the accepted standards of political conduct.\n\n\n# Hardcover 770 Pages\n# Publisher: Grey House Pub; 2 edition (May 30, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 159237297X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1592372973","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0bd8a7123a9012487083ff187f183e62eea302","amp;dn":"Political+Corruption+in+America+%3AAn+Encyclopedia%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0bd8a7123a9012487083ff187f183e62eea302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,11,216,167,18,58,144,18,72,112,131,255,24,127,24,62,98,238,163,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
