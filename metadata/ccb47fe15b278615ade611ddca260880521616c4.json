Grim. And since CharleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last case went so awry, she has taken a couple months off to wallow in the wonders of self-pity. But when a woman shows up on her doorstep convinced someone is trying to kill her, Charley has to force herself to rise above. Or at least get dressed. She quickly realizes something is amiss when everyone the woman knows swears sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insane. The more they refute the womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, the more Charley believes it.\nIn the meantime, the sexy, sultry son of Satan, Reyes Farrow, has been cleared of all charges. He is out of prison and out of CharleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, as per her wishes and several perfectly timed death threats. But his absence has put a serious crimp in her sex life. While there are other things to consider, like the fact that the city of Albuquerque has been taken hostage by an arsonist, Charley is having a difficult time staying away. Especially when it looks like Reyes may be involved. Just when life was returning to normal, Charley is thrust back into the world of crime, punishment, and the devil in blue jeans. \n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
