Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers).\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nLabel:\t\t\tNaive\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Stations\n02.Why Did We Have To Part\n03.That's How Every Empire Falls\n04.No Reason\n05.Prussian Blue\n06.Love Song\n07.Gee Baby\n08.Goin' Back\n09.Past Present Future\n10.Horses And High Heels\n11.Back In Baby's Arms\n12.Eternity\n13.The Old House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c700be0e8d088cc802f9cdc4163aa989276d4d4","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+Horses+And+High+Heels+%282011%29+Mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c700be0e8d088cc802f9cdc4163aa989276d4d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,112,11,224,232,208,136,204,128,47,156,220,65,99,170,152,146,118,212,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
