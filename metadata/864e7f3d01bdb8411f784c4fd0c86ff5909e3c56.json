He was arguably the most liberal-spirited and unqualifiedly humane of all the great nineteenth-century Russian novelists.\n\nHis first major publication of short stories, SKETCHES FROM A HUNTER'S ALBUM (1852), was based on his observations of peasant life and nature and remains a milestone of Russian realism.  Turgenev himself considered the book to be his most important contribution to Russian literature.\n\nHOME OF THE GENTRY (1858) is a novel full of nostalgia for the irretrievable past and of love for the Russian countryside. It contains one of his most memorable female characters, Liza, whom Dostoyevsky paid tribute to in his Pushkin speech of 1880, alongside Tatiana and Tolstoy's Natasha Rostova.\n\nOne of his finest novellas, FIRST LOVE (1860), is based on bitter-sweet childhood memories and the delivery of a speech on &quot;Hamlet and Don Quixote&quot;, presenting a man torn between the self-centered skepticism of Hamlet and the idealistic generosity of Don Quixote.\n\nFATHERS AND SONS (1862) -- here presented in 4 translations -- is Turgenev's most famous and enduring novel and regarded as one of the major works of 19th-century fiction.  Set during a six-year period of social ferment, from Russia's defeat in the Crimean War to the emancipation of the serfs, its leading character, Eugene Bazarov, is considered the &quot;first Bolshevik&quot; in Russian literature, and was in turn heralded and reviled as either a glorification or a parody of the &quot;new men&quot; of the 1860s.  The novel examines the conflict between the older generation, reluctant to accept reforms, and the nihilistic youth.\n\nTurgenev's artistic purity made him a favorite of like-minded novelists of the next generation, such as Henry James and Joseph Conrad, both of whom greatly preferred Turgenev to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky.  James, who wrote no fewer than five critical essays on Turgenev's work, claimed that &quot;his merit of form is of the first order&quot; and praised his &quot;exquisite delicacy&quot;, which &quot;makes too many of his rivals appear to hold us, in comparison, by violent means, and introduce us, in comparison, to vulgar things.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB or PDF format as indicated:\n\n\n                                == Novels &amp; Stories ==\n\n* DREAM TALES AND PROSE POEMS (Macmillan, 1916).
