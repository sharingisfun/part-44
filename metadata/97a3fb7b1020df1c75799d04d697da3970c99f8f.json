His boss, wealthy drug lord Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) forces David to smuggle marijuana from Mexico in order to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires a stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway teenage girl named Casey (Emma Roberts), and his virgin 18 year-old neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to pose as a bogus family called the &quot;Millers,&quot; so as not to arouse suspicion while crossing the border.\n\nThe Millers make the drive across the border in an enormous RV in order to hide the drugs. David picks up the marijuana using the name Pablo Chacon, the name given to him by Gurdlinger. Shortly after the Millers leave the compound, the real Pablo Chacon (Tomer Sisley), a powerful Mexican drug lord, returns with the American that was supposed to be smuggling the drugs across the border and finds that it has already been taken.\n\nReturning to the border, the Millers attempt to look like an ordinary family but are stopped when a drug sniffing dog barks at their RV. They are pulled to the side and as their RV is about to be inspected, four illegals scramble out from under the RV and the officers take off after them, allowing the Millers to leave.\n\nBecause of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the radiator hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had encountered at the border called the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn), and Melissa (Molly Quinn), catch up to them and tow the Millers' RV to a repair shop. On the trip to the shop, David learns that Don Fitzgerald is a DEA agent after discovering his badge and gun in the glove compartment.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a3fb7b1020df1c75799d04d697da3970c99f8f","amp;dn":"We%27re+the+Millers+WebRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a3fb7b1020df1c75799d04d697da3970c99f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,163,251,123,16,32,223,28,117,121,157,4,214,151,218,57,112,201,159,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
