Assisting him is a band of warriors including the strong-willed Pilar (Katina Paxinou in an Oscar winning performance), the dangerously undependable Pablo (Akim Tamiroff) and the lovely, innocent Maria (Bergman). As danger mounts, Robert and Maria develop a closeness that blossoms into one of the screenÃ‚Â´s greatest love stories.\nEpic in scope yet intimate in feeling, For Whom the Bell Tolls remains a shining example of Hollywood moviemaking at its finest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd46bc7b4c899994ae17a3130cc43beb2cc2f13b","amp;dn":"For+Whom+the+Bell+Tolls+Dvd-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd46bc7b4c899994ae17a3130cc43beb2cc2f13b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,70,188,123,76,137,153,148,174,23,163,19,12,196,59,235,44,194,241,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
