Kitschy jingles and the Who's fake commercials for real products mix with pop tunes about the anxieties of youth (&quot;Tattoo&quot;) and troubled relationships (&quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;). The stereo mix showcases choirboy harmonies, while the second disc's mono mix throbs with John Entwistle's meaty bass. A whopping 27 outtakes and alternate versions make this the definitive Sell Out.\n\n\n\n01. Armenia city in the sky\n02. Heinz baked beans\n03. Mary Anne with the shaky hand\n04. Odorono\n05.
