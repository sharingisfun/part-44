KDE edition is based on Kubuntu with KDE Plasma desktop and KDE software.\n\nSome of the reasons for the success of Linux Mint are:\n* It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.\n* It's both free of cost and free as in freedom (open source).\n* It's community-driven. Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint.\n* Based on Debian and Kubuntu, it provides about 30,000 packages and one of the best software managers.\n* It's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware...etc).\n\nThis edition features all the improvements from the latest Linux Mint release on top of KDE 4.9.\n\nRelese notes: http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_nadia_kde_whatsnew.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b21736dc3bf753c6218b1d95a5218a026c56a7","amp;dn":"Linux+Mint+14+KDE+%2832-bit%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b21736dc3bf753c6218b1d95a5218a026c56a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,178,23,54,220,59,247,83,198,33,139,29,149,165,33,138,2,108,86,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
