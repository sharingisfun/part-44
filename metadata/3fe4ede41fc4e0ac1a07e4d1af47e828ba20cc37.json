The program allows you to mix and manipulate bitmaps, vector images and procedural elements. Textures created with Substance Designer are dynamic, ie they can be freely modified at any stage of creation. The user automatically receives the output different cards - diffuse, Norman, specular, etc.\n\nProgram developers have built into it a large number of templates and filters, which greatly simplify the work of the designer. Such filters are for example available &quot;in Bitpam material&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Shadow&quot;, &quot;rust&quot;, etc. Package &quot;Substance Designer&quot; also includes the application &quot;Substance Player&quot; to view your custom textures, and included in the package of training textures.\n\nSubstance Designer supports importing textures from such programs as Photoshop, 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, Unity 3.4 (and higher). The program allows for real-time to make changes and apply effects. In addition, Substance Designer supports vector image format and can work with layers.\n\nIn the new version performed a complete redesign of the stack, adds new effects, feature drag-and-drop and preview the mask. Have also been improved tool at Paint.\n\nAllegorithmic Substance Designer 3.7.1 Build 12763\n\nSubstance Designer 3 is the tool of choice for all your texturing work, whether you are working on Games or Animation / VFX. It has been already chosen by numerous, prestigious and overall great studios over the world as a hub in their pipeline, and for good reasons: Substance Designer includes dedicated and empowering features and tools such as an amazing batching system, letting you batch process numerous meshes and textures at the same time, a live link with Adobe Photoshop letting artists use the tool they want for the job, powerful preset filters and more to speed up texture creation time, all this in a unique non linear environment. Compatible with Substance Player, Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Flame, Unity and Unreal Engine.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Photoshop Workflow\nPaint in Adobe Photoshop and visualize your layers directly in Substance Designer!\nSubstance Designer lets you load and link. PSD files right within your graph and pick the layers you want to use as independent nodes. Do a modification in Photoshop, the corresponding layer will automatically be updated in Substance Designer!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 3D View\nThe unique 3D Views allows you to have a visual feedback of your substance directly on your mesh.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Visual Feedback\nTextures are meant to be used on 3D meshes. With 3D View, you can get an instant feedback of your work-in-progress texture directly on your mesh, saving you lots of time.\nNow supporting tesselation and multi-material, the 3D View lets you see what the final material will look like, with the shader of your choice.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extracting Maps from the Mesh\nSubstance Designer allows you to directly extract the following maps from your mesh:\n- High poly: low poly Tangent maps\n- Position\n- Convert UV to SVG\n- Ambient Occlusion\n- Normal Map Worldspace\n- Curvature Map\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bitmap + SVG + Procedural Painting\nUse what is needed, whatever the situation and your preference: save hundreds of hours by not having to constantly go back and forth between different applications.\nOur new bitmap painting editor comes in 3.1 with a bunch of unique features to help you creating textures faster than ever:\n- Our unique Tiling Mode makes your brush seamlessly tile automatically!\n- This tiling paint works with the brush but also the stamp tool. Never ever has it been that easy to paint tiling textures.\n- The stamp tool finally allows you to pick your source on every node: you will also love this killer feature.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Substance Batchtools\nThanks to Substance Batchtools, replicate your most common operations on all your assets, helping you save tons of time. This batch / scripting capabilities are truly unique in the industry!\nNB: Substance Batchtools can be used only with Substance Designer license, and cannot be shared / distributed with any other program.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Embedded Content\nA lots of content is embedded with Substance Designer, allowing you to create wonderful graphical effects for your textures:\n- Parametric noises\n- Parametric grunge maps\n- Parametric generators: wood, parquet, brick walls, stone, etc.\n- Filters for blending, tiling, adjustment, etc.\n- Mesh adaptive filters\n- Special effects\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Graph Editor\nThe graph editor is the core of Substance Designer, allowing you to produce content in a non-linear / non-destructive authoring process.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Non-Linear Authoring Workflow\nYou are free to make any change you want at any time, and all your changes will automatically be applied to all the outputs of your substance (diffuse, specular, normal, etc), so you can create and edit complete texture sets in a much faster way than with traditional tools.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Non-Destructive Authoring Workflow\nNon-Destructive authoring workflow means you can revert all the actions you are making without losing any of your work. No more &quot;I can't come back to that point&quot;!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Layer System\nOur familiar layer based system is here to help any artists to create content in an easy and friendly way.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Familiar Workflow\nLayers based system has been made for artists not so familiar with the graph editor. This system allows you to create textures and add effects as you would do in other authoring tools. And in case you want to have more controls, Substance Designer will automatically create the corresponding graph when you create effects in the layer mode.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Automatic Tiling\nSubstance Designer allows you to make all your textures tile in an automatic way.\nYou don't need to rework your photo to make it tile before creating your texture.\nJust import your resources into Substance Designer 3 and make them tile automatically!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bitmap2Material Lite\nBitmap2Material Lite is an incredibly powerful filter that helps you generate full, seamlessly tiling materials from any bitmap image.\nThis Lite version of Bitmap2Material is embedded with Substance Designer, to create materials from any picture or photo.\nFeatures:\n- Diffuse control. Sharpen the diffuse output, control HSL and levels.\n- Normal control. Several controls over the normal map intensity and edges.\n- Specular control. Several controls on the influence of the diffuse map over the specular map.\n- Height map control. Control frequencies and levels of the height map.\n- Ambiant occlusion control. Get control over the spreading, strength and levels.\n- Depth Balance. Balancing size of background / foreground elements.\nAnd you can of course use regular Bitmap2Material inside Substance Designer for more control on your materials!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Advanced Noise Graph Editor (FXMaps)\nThe unique FXMaps technology allows you to create animated and parametric noises.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Parametric Noises\nFX-Map allows you to create procedural images. It is one of the most powerful features of the Substance technology.\nThe most common uses of FX-Maps are creating repetitive patterns, such as stripes and bricks, and noises, such as Perlin, Brownian and Gaussian. Noises are particularly useful in creating organic, natural-looking textures like dirt, dust, liquid spatters and so on.\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSupported OS: \n\nWindows XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8.\n\nHomepage: http://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substances\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Follow Activation instrctions given in keygen folder.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fe4ede41fc4e0ac1a07e4d1af47e828ba20cc37","amp;dn":"Allegorithmic+Substance+Designer+v3.7.1+Build+12763+Incl+Kegen+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fe4ede41fc4e0ac1a07e4d1af47e828ba20cc37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,228,237,228,31,196,224,172,26,7,228,209,175,71,232,40,186,32,204,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
