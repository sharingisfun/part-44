Written over the course of two eventful and controversial seasons, This Is The One, offers a unique portrait of Sir Alex Ferguson, living legend, from Daniel TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s position behind the scenes as a football writer covering the club for The Guardian. \nTaylor sees Ferguson at one of the lowest ebbs of his quarter of a century in charge during the 2005-06 season, with a failing team, explosive fallouts with Roy Keane and Ruud van Nistelrooy, a disenchanted fan-base and speculation that he might be forced out of the job. \nThe season that followed demonstrated why Ferguson is still the greatest manager in the game, deposing Chelsea as Premier League champions and eventually seeing off Jose Mourinho. Ferguson would later call it the 'greatest achievement' of his time at EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest football club.\n This Is The One is the close-up, warts-and-all account of what happened during those two helterskelter seasons Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the excruciating lows and the exhilarating highs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the many different sides of Ferguson, from his infamous 'hairdryer' treatment to \nthe softer, more humane side of the best and most successful manager in the entire history of football.\n\n\n\nContains: PDF, MOBI and EPUB\n\nPlease buy the book if you enjoy it!\n\nSeed and Enjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc3331966b68b6a8dcebb494615ebcb949fb197","amp;dn":"This+Is+The+One%3A+Sir+Alex+Ferguson%3A+The+Uncut+Story+of+a+Footbal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc3331966b68b6a8dcebb494615ebcb949fb197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,195,51,25,102,182,139,106,141,206,187,73,70,21,235,203,148,159,177,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
