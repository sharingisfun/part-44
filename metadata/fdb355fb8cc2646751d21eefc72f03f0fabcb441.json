Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context; it would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World.\n\nHawking presents a series of seven lecturesÃ¢â‚¬â€covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theoryÃ¢â‚¬â€that capture not only the brilliance of HawkingÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind but his characteristic wit as well. Of his research on black holes, which absorbed him for more than a decade, he says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It might seem a bit like looking for a black cat in a coal cellar.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHawking begins with a history of ideas about the universe, from AristotleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s determination that the Earth is round to HubbleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s discovery, more than 2,000 years later, that the universe is expanding. Using that as a launching pad, he explores the reaches of modern physics, including theories on the origin of the universe (e.g., the Big Bang), the nature of black holes, and space-time. Finally, he poses the questions left unanswered by modern physics, especially how to combine all the partial theories into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“unified theory of everything.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“If we find the answer to that,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he claims, Ã¢â‚¬Å“it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nPLZ SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdb355fb8cc2646751d21eefc72f03f0fabcb441","amp;dn":"Illustrated+Theory+of+Everything+The+Origin+and+Fate+of+the+Univ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdb355fb8cc2646751d21eefc72f03f0fabcb441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,179,85,251,140,194,100,103,81,210,30,239,199,47,3,240,250,188,180,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
