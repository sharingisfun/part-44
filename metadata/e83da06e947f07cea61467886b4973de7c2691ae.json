It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series.\nIntended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever became infamous in the video games industry and its name became synonymous with vaporware due to its severely-protracted development schedule; the game had been in development since 1996. Upon its release in June 2011, Duke Nukem Forever received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\n\nDeveloper(s)\t3D Realms\nAdditional work by:[show]\nPublisher(s)\t2K Games[4]\nDesigner(s)\tGeorge Broussard\nSeries\tDuke Nukem\nEngine\tModified Unreal Engine 2.5[citation needed]\nPlatform(s)\tMicrosoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3\nRelease date(s)\t\nEU June 10, 2011[5]\nAUS June 10, 2011[5]\nNA June 14, 2011[5]\nGenre(s)\tFirst-person shooter, science fiction\nMode(s)\tSingle-player, multiplayer\nRating(s)\t\nACB: MA15+[6]\nBBFC: 18\nCERO: Z\nESRB: M\nPEGI: 18+\nUSK: 18\nMedia/distribution\tBlu-ray Disc, DVD, Steam\nSystem requirements\nMicrosoft Windows\nMinimum Specs\nIntel Core 2 Duo @ 2.0 Ghz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 @ 2.0 Ghz\n1GB RAM\nnVidia GeForce 7600 / ATI Radeon HD 2600 or equivalent with 256MB video memory\nWindows XP/Vista/7 OS\n10GB free hard disk space\nDirectX Compatible sound card\nRecommended Specs\nIntel Core 2 Duo @ 2.4 Ghz / AMD Athlon 64 X2 @ 2.6 Ghz or better\n2GB RAM\nnVidia GeForce 8800 GTS / ATI Radeon HD 3850 or better, with 512MB video memory\nWindows XP/Vista/7 OS\n10GB free hard disk space\nDirectX Compatible sound card\n\nCrack Included\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83da06e947f07cea61467886b4973de7c2691ae","amp;dn":"Duke+Nukem+Forever+%5BMULTI5%5D%5BPCDVD%5D%5BRazor1911%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83da06e947f07cea61467886b4973de7c2691ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,61,160,110,148,127,7,206,166,20,103,136,107,73,115,222,124,38,145,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
