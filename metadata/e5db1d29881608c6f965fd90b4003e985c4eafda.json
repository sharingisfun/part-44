Leading the defense is London solicitor Daniel Hunter, a champion of lost causes.\n\nA damaged boy from a troubled home, Daniel's young client, Sebastian, reminds Daniel of his own turbulent childhood--and of Minnie, the devoted woman whose love saved him. But one terrible act of betrayal irrevocably shattered their bond.\n\nAs past and present collide, Daniel is faced with disturbing questions. Will his sympathy for Sebastian and his own memories blind him to the truth? What happened in the park--and who, ultimately, is to blame for a little boy's death? Rethinking everything he's ever believed, Daniel begins to understand what it means to be wrong . . . and to be the guilty one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5db1d29881608c6f965fd90b4003e985c4eafda","amp;dn":"The+Guilty+One+-+Lisa+Ballantyne.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5db1d29881608c6f965fd90b4003e985c4eafda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,219,29,41,136,22,8,198,249,101,253,144,180,0,62,152,92,78,175,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
