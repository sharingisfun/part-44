We focus equally on both style and     ::::::\n quality, and if your reading our info, you already know that. We&amp;#039;re  ::::::\n now in our fifth year, and we feel pretty confident about the work   ::::::\n we do. We have brought music to the masses, and in doing so          ::::::\n hopefully made their lives that much better. For us, that is what    ::::::\n its all about, and thats what keeps us going.                        ::::::\n                                                                      ::::::\n We purchase records and rip them so other people can hear the tracks ::::::\n and decide if they want to buy! We have paid for our records and     ::::::\n think you should also, if you do not subscribe to this, you are part ::::::\n of the problem.  So if you like a release please buy it. Don&amp;#039;t be a  ::::::\n skanky bitch about the price, just pay it! In doing so, you are      ::::::\n supporting what we all love so much. We sleep good at night cause we ::::::\n support the artists that produces electronic music, without whom we  ::::::\n wouldn&amp;#039;t have so much material to enjoy.  We know some releases are  ::::::\n nearly impossible to find, so buy something else you like instead :D ::::::\n                                                                      ::::::\n The electronic music scene ain&amp;#039;t like the pop and rock scene. Where  ::::::\n fans pays Euro100 for a ticket to a concert! It&amp;#039;s smaller and        ::::::\n artists rely on units sold.  Since you probably downloaded this      ::::::\n release and think you can have it for free -- you&amp;#039;re wrong.  That    ::::::\n mindset is killing the artists and the scene. Its simple, support    ::::::\n the people who support you, musically.                               ::::::\n                                                                      ::::::\n We at TechnoRulez are adamant about any of releases being posted in  ::::::\n public scene dupingchans and prechans! Please respect that, and      ::::::\n remove our releases from the db&amp;#039;s. We insist that the scene must be  ::::::\n kept underground, and if the clueless lamers using such chans and    ::::::\n websites cant comply with the terms, you will see alot less of us.   ::::::\n That doesn&amp;#039;t mean we will slow down, but we will take action to keep ::::::\n our releases internal or a very limited spread.  It is simply        ::::::\n unacceptable to post scene related info on *any* public source at    ::::::\n *any* time.
