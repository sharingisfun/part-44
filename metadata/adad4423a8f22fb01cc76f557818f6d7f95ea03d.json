Launched in the bayside college town of Bellingham, Washington, the group was originally a side project for singer/guitarist Ben Gibbard, an engineering student at Western Washington University who split his time between school and music. Taking a break from his local power pop band, Pinwheel, Gibbard began recording an album's worth of solo material during the summer of 1997. Producer Chris Walla lent his help to the sessions, which resulted in an eight-song cassette entitled You Can Play These Songs with Chords. When the tape became a local hit, Gibbard reached into his circle of friends to form a band, hoping to play the new songs live. Bassist Nick Harmer (Gibbard's roommate) and drummer Nathan Good climbed aboard, and Walla enlisted as the band's primary guitarist (he would also go on to produce most of the band's future releases). With a lineup now in place, Gibbard's group rechristened itself Death Cab for Cutie (named after a song by the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and signed a contract with the Seattle-based Barsuk Records within a year's time. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Atlantic\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.No Room In Frame\n02.Black Sun\n03.The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive\n04.Little Wanderer\n05.You've Haunted Me All My Life\n06.Hold No Guns\n07.Everything's A Ceiling\n08.Good Help (Is So Hard To Find)\n09.El Dorado\n10.Ingenue\n11.Binary Sea\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adad4423a8f22fb01cc76f557818f6d7f95ea03d","amp;dn":"Death+Cab+For+Cutie+-+Kintsugi+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adad4423a8f22fb01cc76f557818f6d7f95ea03d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,173,68,35,168,242,47,176,28,199,111,85,120,24,246,215,249,94,160,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
