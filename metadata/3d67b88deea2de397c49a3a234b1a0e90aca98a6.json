Although the group had always been keen on improvisation, both as their principal songwriting method and onstage, this was their first (and, thus far, only) album to be comprised entirely of such material. It was Eno's idea that the group's improvisations should be recorded, having told them that he regarded this music as having equal importance to the finished songs birthed from it. However, the group told Stuart Maconie (for their authorised biography Folklore) that the album caused disagreements, particularly over Tim Booth's wish to redo some vocals and over how to deal with the finished record - originally planned as a giveaway with early copies of Laid, it was eventually issued as a limited edition several months later.\n\nOne track, Jam-J was chosen as a single, and released as a double-A side, along with &quot;Say Something&quot; from the album Laid.\n\nThe track &quot;Tomorrow&quot; was later re-recorded from scratch and placed on the band's next release, the album Whiplash as well as being culled as the second single from that record.\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1.
