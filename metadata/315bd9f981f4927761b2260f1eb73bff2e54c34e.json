They then recruited Eric Wood on guitar, Tony Starcevich on drums and Casey Mejia on keyboards. The band self-released two records before their major label debut, in a self-titled four-song EP and a full-length LP The Other Side.\n\nIn 2001, they signed with Roadrunner Records and released their debut album Untitled on March 19, 2002. After almost a full year of touring, vocalist Daniel Struble and guitarist Sharon Grzelinski parted ways with the band.[2] Despite the remaining members vowing to continue on, the band later disbanded.\n\nStruble and Grzelinski later formed a new band called The Renaissance, and the other members (excluding Mejia) started another band called The Burning Down. &quot;The Renaissance&quot; no longer exists but &quot;The Burning Down&quot; still regularly plays shows in and around the Joliet area.\n\nIn the winter of 2006 Daniel Struble and Sharon Grzelinski started a new band called Zillion with Kyle from The Renaissance.\n\n\nFive Pointe O - Untitled - 2002\n\nGenres \tAlternative metal, Metalcore, Post-hardcore\n\n01 Double X Minus\n02 King Of The Hill\n03 Art Of Cope\n04 Purity O1\n05 Freedom-\n06 Sympathetic Climate Control\n07 Untitled\n08 Syndrome Down\n09 Breath Machine\n10 The Infinity\n11 Aspire, Inspire\n\nBitrate 360\n120MB\nLength 52:39\n\ncheck out my other rare torrents, bands that disband","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315bd9f981f4927761b2260f1eb73bff2e54c34e","amp;dn":"Five+Pointe+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315bd9f981f4927761b2260f1eb73bff2e54c34e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,91,217,249,129,244,146,119,97,178,38,15,30,183,59,255,46,84,195,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
