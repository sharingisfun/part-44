Recording several albums over the next couple of years, most of their repertoire consisted of covers of popular rock and surf tunes; undeniably exciting at the time, their lack of originality can make their work generic to wade through. The moody &quot;K-39,&quot; also available on surf compilations, is their most famous cut.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifyxqw5ldfe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifyxqw5ldfe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nClocking in at 30 tracks, this is a top-heavy collection of surf sides the Challengers cut for the GNP/Crescendo label. As the group never really had a hit, this is arguably all the Challengers you might ever need for the collection. But it is grade-A surf music, extremely well played with various session ringers like Hal Blaine, Jim Keltner, Steve Douglas, and Paul Johnson brought in on various numbers.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fzfwxquhldde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fzfwxquhldde&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
