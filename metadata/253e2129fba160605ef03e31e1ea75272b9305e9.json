MacRuby, a Ruby 1.9 implementation that sits directly on the Mac OS X core, gives Rubyists the potential to code Cocoa apps without sacrificing the language features they've come to depend on.\n\nMacRuby In Action is a tutorial for Ruby developers who want to code for OS X without learning Objective-C. Readers will learn the ins and outs of the MacRuby language, including straightforward examples of creating OS X applications using Cocoa components. The core of the book is an example-driven tour of the Cocoa framework from the Ruby perspective that focuses on getting things done.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 272 pages\n# Publisher: Manning Publications; 1 edition (April 17, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1935182498\n# ISBN-13: 978-1935182498","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:253e2129fba160605ef03e31e1ea75272b9305e9","amp;dn":"MacRuby+in+Action+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"253e2129fba160605ef03e31e1ea75272b9305e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,62,33,41,251,161,96,96,94,240,62,49,225,234,117,39,43,147,5,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
