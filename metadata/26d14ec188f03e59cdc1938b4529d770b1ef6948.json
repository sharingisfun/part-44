The Terran Starfleet is vastly outgunned, and quickly capitulates. In order to gain full control, Sato invites General Shran, commander of the Andorian Imperial Guard, to be her consort. However, Shran has his own agenda to follow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one that could lead to the downfall of the Empire. Meanwhile, T'Pol Ã¢â‚¬â€œ having escaped from custody Ã¢â‚¬â€œ joins with the Rebellion, and aides in uniting their disparate leaders into a coherent force. When the Defiant is drawn away from Earth long enough for the Rebellion to launch a devastating attack, Sato is secretly deposed, and eventually captured by the rebels. All this leads to a final confrontation, one which will change the shape of the quadrant. \n\nStar Trek : Mirror Universe - 002 - Obsidian Alliances - Keith R. A. Decandido &amp; Peter David &amp; Sarah Shaw - Contains three short novels set within the mirror universe, one among the Deep Space Nine crew's counterparts, one among the Voyager crew's counterparts, and one among the counterparts of the Star Trek: New Frontier crew, all set in the same general time period. \n\nStar Trek : Mirror Universe - 003 - Shards and Shadows - Marco Palmieri &amp; Margaret A.

Since the alternate universe was first glimpsed in the classic episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, something about Star Trek's dark side has beckoned us, called to us, tempted us Ã¢â‚¬â€œ like forbidden fruit on the Tree of Knowledge. To taste it is to lose oneself in a world of startling familiarity and terrifying contradictions, where everything and everyone we knew is somehow disturbingly different, and where shocking secrets await their revelation. \n\nStar Trek : Mirror Universe - 004 - The Sorrows of Empire - David Mack - Captain James T. Kirk of the United Federation of Planets spoke those prophetic words to Commander Spock of the Terran Empire, hoping to inspire change. He could not have imagined the impact his counsel would have.

Light-years away, Mac Calhoun and his Romulan allies harass Klingon forces with devious hit-and-run attacks. But Calhoun has a grander ambition: he intends to merge his fleet with the Terran Rebellion and lead it to victoryÃ¢â‚¬â€œor die trying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d14ec188f03e59cdc1938b4529d770b1ef6948","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+Mirror+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d14ec188f03e59cdc1938b4529d770b1ef6948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,209,78,193,136,240,62,89,205,193,147,139,69,41,215,112,177,239,105,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
