That is unfortunate for us.\n\nThe first (7) tracks are from the only album he recorded during a 16 year period\n\nhe spent as a sign painter, while maintaining his chops in local performance.\n\n\nI've added (5) warhorses; tracks 8-12 to showcase his blinding speed.  Tracks 10-12\n\nmay be vinyl rips...it's been a while since I put this together.  Track #10\n\ndoesn't sound physically possible.\n\n\nTrack #6; MY ROMANCE is unique.  Tal employs some sort of light touch technique on \n\nthe fretboard to produce ethereal harmonic tones appx. half way through the tune.\n\nTrack #6 gives me chills each time I hear it.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d25f142f7c4cf9011881e23afdaadd8a443ba775","amp;dn":"Tal+Farlow%2CTHE+RETURN+OF+TAL...1969+%28%2B5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d25f142f7c4cf9011881e23afdaadd8a443ba775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,95,20,47,124,76,249,1,24,129,226,58,253,170,221,138,68,59,167,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
