Samuel emotionally withdrew from his family thirteen years earlier after the death of his beloved son Billy, and still resents the fact that Billy died while Alfred lives. Samuel begrudgingly offers his son a position in the family business, but Alfred is moving to New York to launch an aircraft business with his old friend Lex Porter.\n\nWhile attending a party at the estate of Lex's wealthy uncle, Alfred makes a play for Mary St. John, the stunning daughter of a Main Line family. Mary is secretly engaged to Dr. Jim Roper, but she is sexually drawn to Alfred, and soon the two are embroiled in a tempestuous relationship. Mary's snobbish parents object that Alfred's father is a nobody and his mother is a drunk, but Mary defies them. Alfred asks his father for a loan to finance his share of the aircraft company, but Samuel humiliates Alfred and begins to sob for the lost Billy. A furious Alfred storms out in disgust, after which Samuel suffers a heart attack.\n\nOn his wedding day, Alfred receives word that his father has died. Certain that Samuel has timed his death to spite him, Alfred goes ahead with the ceremony. With his uncle's money, Lex and Alfred then fund the Nassau Aircraft Corporation, but when Lex shows more interest in perfecting aircraft designs than in selling planes, Alfred becomes impatient.\n\nOne wintry day, Alfred and Mary are driving home from a party when they see a little boy fall through the thin ice of a frozen pond. Alfred plunges into the icy waters to save him. The boy's grandfather, James Duncan MacHardie, the most famous financier in America, invites Alfred and Mary to dinner. MacHardie, a shrewd businessman, senses Alfred's drive and ambition, and when Alfred asserts that his goal in life is to earn more money than his father, MacHardie offers him a job in his investment firm.\n\n\nFROM THE TERRACE (1960)  Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward h264 AVC DVD RIP.mp4\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                   : Nero Digital AVC HDTV Profile\nCodec ID                         : ndxh\nFile size                        : 1.35 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 24mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 346 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2010-08-22 02:13:12\nTagged date                      : UTC 2010-08-22 10:52:12\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;377f5e505f777b041907&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 2 frames\nCodec ID                         : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                    : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                         : 2h 23mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1 215 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 5 750 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.231\nStream size                      : 1.22 GiB (90%)\nLanguage                         : English\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2010-08-22 02:13:12\nTagged date                      : UTC 2010-08-22 10:52:12\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nFormat settings, SBR             : Yes\nFormat settings, PS              : No\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 2h 24mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 129 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 157 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 133 MiB (10%)\nLanguage                         : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:259e530a173062aab0c72e0adb7dc5d4dfcc4910","amp;dn":"FROM+THE+TERRACE+%281960%29++Paul+Newman%2C+Joanne+Woodward+h264+AVC+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"259e530a173062aab0c72e0adb7dc5d4dfcc4910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,158,83,10,23,48,98,170,176,199,46,10,219,125,197,212,223,204,73,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
