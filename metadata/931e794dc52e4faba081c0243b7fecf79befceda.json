Link below.\n\nWhen PokÃƒÂ©mon first came out in Japan, they were known as PokÃƒÂ©mon Red &amp; Green. Several months later, the first third version came out, called PokÃƒÂ©mon Blue. In the Japanese Pokemon Blue, the sprites were different, the wild PokÃƒÂ©mon were changed, the in-game trades were changed, the Cerulean Cave layout was changed, and the tileset graphics were changed. When they decided to localize PokÃƒÂ©mon, rather than translating Pokemon Red &amp; Green, they decided to translate PokÃƒÂ©mon Blue, and keep the graphics of PokÃƒÂ©mon Blue, but use the wild PokÃƒÂ©mon and in-game trades from PokÃƒÂ©mon Red &amp; Green. Do you know what this means? Not very many people know what Kanto originally looked like! And I'm not talking about PokÃƒÂ©mon Red &amp; Blue that you've all played, I'm talking about the original originals!\n\nDid that not make sense? Well, imagine it like this: Let's pretend PokÃƒÂ©mon Diamond &amp; Pearl was never released in America, and PokÃƒÂ©mon Platinum already came out in Japan. Then let's pretend they finally decide to release PokÃƒÂ©mon Diamond &amp; Pearl in America, so they take PokÃƒÂ©mon Platinum, change the wild PokÃƒÂ©mon to the Diamond/Pearl ones, and then release it as Diamond &amp; Pearl, even though it's actually Platinum. That's exactly what happened in Gen I!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook at this picture to see the differences of the graphics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaliAAAEB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaliAAAEB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOn the left side is what the Japanese Pokemon Blue, and the International Pokemon Red &amp; Blue looks like, on the right side is what the Japanese Pokemon Red &amp; Green looks like.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownload Visual Boy Advance: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7941177/Pokemon_Liquid_Crystal_3.2___VBA_1.8.0.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7941177/Pokemon_Liquid_Crystal_3.2___VBA_1.8.0.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out my other torrents for more Pokemon ROM hacks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:931e794dc52e4faba081c0243b7fecf79befceda","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Blue+with+Original+Graphics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"931e794dc52e4faba081c0243b7fecf79befceda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,30,121,77,197,46,79,171,160,129,192,36,59,127,236,247,155,239,206,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
