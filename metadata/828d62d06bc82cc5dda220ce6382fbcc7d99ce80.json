As we learn of the tragic events that led to BradÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival, unforeseen circumstances threaten to tear the reform facility apart, forcing Brad to confront not only his fellow inmates and the personnel in charge, but finally his own sense of what is right and what is wrong.\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nDirector: Vincent Grashaw\n\nActors: PJ Boudousque, James C.
