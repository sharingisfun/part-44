Garrett also gave Phil Spector his first job in the business, as A&amp;R man in New York for Liberty. He produced a series of LPs for Liberty under the name of &quot;The 50 Guitars of Tommy Garrett,&quot; one of the least adventurous and most easy-listening guitar groups, usually arranged by Ernie Wilkins and with Tommy Tedesco as lead guitar. Garrett also produced a number of exotica recordings by &quot;The Midnight String Quartet&quot; and Jonathan Knight on the Viva! label.\n\n\nArtist: Tommy Garrett and The 50 Guitars \nLPs: 13\nBitrate: most @ 320 kbps\nScans: Included\nYears: 1958-1966\n.\n.\nLPs and TRACKS\n.\nTommy Garrett - Down Mexico Way\n01 El condor pasa\n02 Tangerine\n03 My Shawl\n04 Carmen\n05 Deguello\n06 Tico Tico\n07 Say Si Si\n08 Oye Negra\n09 La Nave del Olvido\n10 A Gay Ranchero\n11 Cascado\n12 Adelita\n.\nTommy Garrett - Go Italiano\n01 O Sole Mio\n02 Al-Di-La\n03 Summertime In Venice\n04 Non Dimenticar\n05 Return To Me\n06 Love Theme from Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½La StradaÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½\n07 Volare\n08 Come Back To Sorrento\n09 Mattinata\n10 CiaoÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ Ciao, Bambina\n12 ArrivederciÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ Roma  \n.\nTommy Garrett - Go South of the Border Vol2\n01 El rancho grande\n02 Mexicali rose\n03 Cielito lindo\n04 Fantasia mexicana\n05 Te quiero dijiste\n06 Malaguena\n07 Mexican Hat Dance\n08 Amor\n09 Estrellita\n10 Aquellos ojos verdes\n11 La Paloma\n12 Vaya con Dios   \n.\nTommy Garrett - Go South of the Border Vol3\n01.
