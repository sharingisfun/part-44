The file extension is *.ape . Once i had the decoder for &quot;Monkey&amp;#039;s&quot; installed Winamp played it great, i suggest using the same. For burning i would use Poikosoft&amp;#039;s Easy CD-DA Extractor, the reason for this is for one it is what i used to rip it with and for reason 2 is it also can burn it to cd for you. I tried using nero with the &quot;Monkey&amp;#039;s audio decoder nero plugin&quot;, but it made nero unstable so i would not suggest this. Please i love to hear comments and i welcome them good or bad. Plus i will also warn you there is no album art sorry but there is a m3u file. Well last but not least please seed for at least a week as it hard to find good 80&amp;#039;s music in Lossless format which was not re-recorded from previous downloaded files, this copy came from a pristine unscratched original cd. I liked all but 2 songs but even they didn&amp;#039;t warrant skipping over!! Enjoy!! \n\n\nHere&amp;#039;s the tracklist \n\n\n1. I&amp;#039;m Gonna Be Strong \n2. Girls Just Wanna Have Fun \n3. Money Changes Everything \n4. Time After Time \n5. She Bop \n6. All Through The Night \n7. Change Of Heart \n8. True Colors \n9. What&amp;#039;s Going On \n10. I Drove All Night \n11.
