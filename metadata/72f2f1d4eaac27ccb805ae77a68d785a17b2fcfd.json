I have finally found a game I have been after for ages and seems near impossible to get from torrents now. Hope you like it!\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Harvey Birdman - Attorney at Law [RGBE08] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Adventure (cool, but quite weird!)\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 740+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all the Wii games they can...\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72f2f1d4eaac27ccb805ae77a68d785a17b2fcfd","amp;dn":"Wii+Harvey+Birdman+-+Attorney+at+Law+%5BRGBE08%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72f2f1d4eaac27ccb805ae77a68d785a17b2fcfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,242,241,212,234,172,39,204,184,5,174,119,166,141,120,90,23,178,252,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
