These essays put forth empirical arguments to claim that specific theoretical assumptions concerning the lexicon play a crucial role in resolving problems pertaining to other components of grammar. Topics include: syntactic/semantic interface in the areas of aspect, argument structure, and thematic roles; lexicon-based accounts of quirky case, anaphora, and control; the boundary between the lexicon and syntax in the domains of sentence comprehension and nominal compounding; and the possibility of extending the concept of blocking beyond the traditional lexicon. Ivan Sag is a professor of linguistics at Stanford University. Anna Szabolcsi is an associate professor of linglustics at UCLA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68909ee0b17ec645b90a13f788d8b01ede12d142","amp;dn":"Lexical+Matters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68909ee0b17ec645b90a13f788d8b01ede12d142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,144,158,224,177,126,198,69,185,10,19,247,136,216,176,30,222,18,209,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
