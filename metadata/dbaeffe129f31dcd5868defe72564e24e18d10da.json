Our co-operation with the NDR was of great importance to us and we were there regularly. This was one of the main reasons why Swedish jazz was so famous in Germany at the time. Producer Hans Gertberg invited several European jazz musicians to the workshops and also many Swedish ones, recalls Riedel. The creativity over there was something truly extraordinary. Usually, we did not play songs out of our normal repertoire, but rather created something special for the workshops. The lineup was often especially put together for this occasion.\nShortly before his death Johansson wrote the music for the first Pippi Longstocking film - a demo tape with the melody of HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r kommer Pippi LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ngstrump was all that was left after the accident. Riedel continued to work on the film music of Astrid Lindgrens books until the 1980s. The world-famous childrens song concludes the album as a tribute to its creator - a jazz legend who died long before his time.
