Younger hungrier realms wait like vultures for their chance to pick at the carcass. Thus begins the grand campaign of Sovereignty.\r\n\r\nRule your realm wisely and decisively. Play as the Boruvian Empire and try to recapture former Imperial glories. Or play any of 34 other realms, each with their own rich history, culture and play-style.\r\n\r\nPlay as different cultures and races: Humans, Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and Undead. Guide your people to glory and prosperity. The challenges you are going to face are intimately linked to the faction you select and the geography of your location in the world. Whether you build a wealthy kingdom or become a famous conqueror, your subjects will expect you to make the right diplomatic and economic decisions. Do you covet a precious resource produced by your neighbor? Try sending an agent to negotiate a trade dealâ€¦ or your army to seize this key region","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa4d2c086872661d7bc0ebcab2581afc90aad13","amp;dn":"Sovereignty%3A+Crown+of+Kings+v2.0.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa4d2c086872661d7bc0ebcab2581afc90aad13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,164,210,192,134,135,38,97,215,188,14,188,171,37,129,175,201,10,173,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
