Of the album's songs, perhaps the most noteworthy selection was Parton's folksy cover of Led Zeppelin's classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœStairway to HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (with which Zep singer Robert Plant was said to be pleased). The album was nominated for three Grammy Awards. Parton embarked on her first tour in 10 years in support of the album. The sold-out Halos and Horns Tour played the United States and the United Kingdom. The cover photo was taken by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz.
