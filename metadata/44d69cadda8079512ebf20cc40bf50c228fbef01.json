Inspired by the Free Spirit favorite 100 Things Guys Need to Know, this do-it-yourself comic book features cartooning exercises and prompts that get boys thinking about important subjects in their lives, including family, friends, school, health, and the future.

Some of the interactive exercises feature completed comic strip panels where boys imagine and write the dialog. Others let guys draw comic strips of their own. Freestyle activities let kids personalize the book and explore who they are. Web extensions point the way to additional fun, interactive resources online.\nComic books and graphic novels help educators and parents get reluctant readers interested in books. Your Life in Comics goes a step further and helps get guys thinking and writing about critical topics in their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d69cadda8079512ebf20cc40bf50c228fbef01","amp;dn":"Your+Life+in+Comics+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d69cadda8079512ebf20cc40bf50c228fbef01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,214,156,173,218,128,121,81,46,191,32,204,64,191,80,194,40,251,239,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
