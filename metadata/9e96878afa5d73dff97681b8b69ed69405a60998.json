In this penetrating analysis and comprehensive refutation of three recently-published biographies of Leon Trotsky by well-known British historians -- Professors Robert Service, Ian Thatcher and Geoffrey Swain -- David North raises troubling questions about the state of contemporary historical scholarship.\n\nIn the June 2011 edition of the prestigious American Historical Review historian Bertrand Patenaude gives NorthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book high praise: Ã¢â‚¬Å“A careful examination of NorthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book shows his criticism of Service to be exactly what Trotsky scholar Baruch Knei-Paz, in a blurb on the back cover, says it is: Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdetailed, meticulous, well-argued and devastating.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nScott McClemee, a columnist for Inside Higher Education, writes, &quot;I can only suggest that any research library that has added ServiceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book to its collection should consider acquiring David NorthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as well.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nExposing recent efforts to denigrate TrotskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historical role by falsifying history, North insists that their aim is to forestall a resurgence of interest in the great revolutionist at a time when millions of people are becoming disenchanted with capitalism. North reviews the decisive and often overlooked impact of TrotskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of Permanent Revolution on the events of October 1917. He challenges todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s historians to once again turn serious and honest attention to TrotskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and ideas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e96878afa5d73dff97681b8b69ed69405a60998","amp;dn":"In+Defense+of+Leon+Trotsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e96878afa5d73dff97681b8b69ed69405a60998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,150,135,138,250,93,115,223,249,118,129,184,182,158,214,148,5,166,9,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
