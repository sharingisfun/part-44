But how do our tribal impulses, still in place and in play, fit in the highly complex, civilized world we inhabit today? This question, raised by thinkers from Freud to Levi-Strauss, is fully explored in this book by the acclaimed anthropologist Robin Fox. It takes up what he sees as the mainÃ¢â‚¬â€and urgentÃ¢â‚¬â€task of evolutionary science: not so much to explain what we do, as to explain what we do at our peril.\n\nRanging from incest and arranged marriage to poetry and myth to human rights and pop icons, Fox sets out to show how a variety of human behaviors reveal traces of their tribal roots, and how this evolutionary past limits our capacity for action. Among the questions he raises: How real is our notion of time? Is there a human Ã¢â‚¬Å“rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to vengeance? Are we democratic by nature? Are cultural studies and fascism cousins under the skin? Is evolutionary history coming to an endÃ¢â‚¬â€or just getting more interesting? In his famously informative and entertaining fashion, drawing links from Volkswagens to Bartok to Woody Guthrie, from Swinburne to Seinfeld, Fox traces our ongoing struggle to maintain open societies in the face of profoundly tribal human needsÃ¢â‚¬â€needs which, paradoxically, hold the key to our survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:869191c34fdbe3c15071fb2396943725d420550b","amp;dn":"Robin+Fox+-+The+Tribal+Imagination%3A+Civilizaiton+and+the+Savage+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"869191c34fdbe3c15071fb2396943725d420550b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,145,145,195,79,219,227,193,80,113,251,35,150,148,55,37,212,32,85,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
