Unfortunately only remembered for the classic track Echo Beach (a real place in Toronto by the way, but at the time of writing the group didn't know this) they never got the recognition they truly deserved. As with many other Canadian musicians such as Arcade Fire their style, substance and creativity is often overshadowed by the shallow sex, commercialism, greed and money of those crazy lunatics that live next door. God I hate yanks\n\nCanada you have our sympathy and respect.\n\nI also included a video of echo beach generously provided by RosaMannen, cheers mate. There is also small selection of pics and a recent cover of the famous echo beach by Gabriella Cilmi.\n\n\nPlease seed this if there is less than a dozen seeds or for a few weeks if you would. You aint paid for this so give others the same grace.\n\n&quot;Danseparc&quot;, &quot;Mystery Walk&quot;, &quot;Trance And Dance&quot; &amp; &quot;This Is The Ice Age&quot; albums are well worth hunting down if you like this.\n\nFar Away In Time Tracks \n\n1\tEcho Beach\n2\tPaint by Number Heart\n3\tSaigon\n4\tIndecision\n5\tTerminal Twilight\n6\tHide and Seek\n7\tMonotone\n8\tSinking Land\n9\tRevenge (Against the World)\n10\tCheesies and Gum\n11\tInsect Love\n12\tAbout Insomnia\n13\tMotorbikin'\n14\tSuburban Dream\n15\tWas Ezo\n16\tWomen Around the World at Work\n17\tThis Is the Ice Age\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6ceccd51dcffcec479984f137089eb27e681bc","amp;dn":"Martha+and+the+Muffins+-+Far+Away+In+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6ceccd51dcffcec479984f137089eb27e681bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,108,236,205,81,220,255,206,196,121,152,79,19,112,137,235,39,230,129,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
