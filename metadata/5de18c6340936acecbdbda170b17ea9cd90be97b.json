While adjusting to her new bionic powers and raising a rebellious younger sister, Jaime agrees to work for the Berkut Group, a quasi-governmental private organization that performed her surgery.\n\nBartender Jaime Sommers struggles to make ends meet in San Francisco, California, while serving as a surrogate mom to her teenage sister. Nearly killed in a car accident, Jaime is saved by a cutting-edge operationÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½performed by her boyfriend, Will AnthrosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½that leaves her with advanced bionic prosthetics and implants with extraordinary new strength, among other artificially enhanced gifts. Now, however, Jaime must figure out how best to use her new abilities while embracing her new bionic identity.\n\nThe website for the UK newspaper Daily Mail published photographs from the pilot film that reveal that in addition to a bionic ear, Sommers will receive a bionic eye like that of Steve Austin, along with her bionic legs and bionic right arm. Clips from the pilot episode posted on the show\\&amp;#039;s official preview webpage also reveal that she will have a bionic ear and be injected with nanomachines called anthrocytes that heal her body at a highly accelerated rate.\n\nJohnson has confirmed on his website that he is not involved with the new Bionic Woman series. Since the rights to The Six Million Dollar Man and Cyborg are held by other parties, the characters of Oscar Goldman and Dr. Rudy Wells from the original franchise have been replaced by new creations and it has yet to be seen whether they or the character of Steve Austin will appear in the new series. The new version of Sommers is outfitted with a bionic eye; this is a piece of hardware established by Caidin in his original novel as being given to Austin and used in the subsequent TV series (the original Jaime Sommers did not possess one); thus far, this is the only overt reference to Martin Caidin\\&amp;#039;s original concepts in evidence.\n\nDisc 1:\n1 Pilot - September 26, 2007\n2 Paradise - Lost October 3, 2007\n3 Sisterhood - October 10, 2007\n4 Face off - October 17, 2007\n\nDisc 2:\n5 The Education Of Jaime Summers - October 24, 2007\n6 The List - November 7, 2007\n7 Trust Issues - November 14, 2007\n8 Do Not Disturb - November 28, 2007\n\nI have made this torrent in 2 files so they will fit on to 2 discs, the 1st disc is 1-4 and the second is 5-8\n\nImage:\nWidth = 640 pixels\nHeight = 360 pixels\n\nAudio:\nDuration = disc 1 = 02:49:24. disc 2 = 02:48:02\nBit Rate = 12kbps\nFormat = MP3\n\nVideo:\nFrames per second = 25fps\nData Rate = 77kbps\n\nThis is my 1st TV upload so please leave a comment so I can improve my next uploads.
