No need to close RoboForm before patching; the patch will kill the processes for you.  All you need to do is run the RoboForm TaskBar Icon after patching.\n\nSee included screen shots of both RF editions with and without Sync enabled.\n\nCurrently working on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 and Windows 8 Pro x64. (It should work on all Windows versions that run RoboForm)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: To date, there is still no universal patch for roboform-x64.dll, so you will have to continue using a 32-bit browser or pay for a legitimate Roboform license to enable 64-bit browser support. (or find another patched roboform-x64.dll for this version of RF)\n\nNOTE 2: I have seen the rare comment that the patch doesn't work after version &quot;blah blah blah&quot; (it's always different).  If at first you don't succeed, try running the patch a 2nd time.\n\nVirusTotal results for the patch reveal 'generic' malware flags (6/46) since it IS a functional patcher.\nResults URL: https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5663a7ec1fc12f19fc6a582340960bcf8d6f7435f9328d39467081bfd046badf/analysis/1367295054/\n\n----------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.roboform.com/support/news&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.roboform.com/support/news&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNews and details from current and past versions of RoboForm.\n\nVersion 7.9.1 -- Aug 19, 2013 \n* Firefox: fix Firefox may disable RoboForm after RF update or on 1st install. \n* Firefox: fix favicons are not being saved. \n* Firefox: fix dropdown menu appears misplaced in FF 22 on high DPI monitors. \n* Firefox: fix importing passworkds from Firefox. \n* Firefox: fix RF in FF is causing slowdown on\n* Form Fill and Submit: fix several issues related to specific sites. \n* Chrome: fix double click on scrollbar in identity or passcard list may lead to inifinte scroll. \n* Chrome: add separate setting for Floating/Lower RF toolbar for HTML popup windows. \n* Chrome: fix some functions of RF do not work in Chrome-based browsers. \n* Opera: add support for Opera 15, which is the same as Chromium. \n* Start page: fix sometimes it shows less items than specified in option. \n* Internet Explorer: offer to disable EPM, as RoboForm does not work with it enabled. \n* Installer: improve browser closer. \n* Most Recently Used: fix passcard files are rewritten too often when Start Page items are moved. \n* Sync with RF Everywhere: fix error processing. \n* Sync with RF Everywhere: treat sync asserts as lower level warnings. \n* Fix support of PIV Smart Cards. \n* Options dialog: rewritten using sib-forms framework. \n* PrintList dialog: use better design, rewrite it in stables. \n* AutoUpdate: optimize checking for RoboForm version on our server.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85eedf4e6d74ed5dff93765758808bf104f62554","amp;dn":"RoboForm+Pro+v7.9.1.1+Desktop%2FRoboForm2Go+%5Bonttm%5D+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85eedf4e6d74ed5dff93765758808bf104f62554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,238,223,78,109,116,237,93,255,147,118,87,88,128,139,241,4,246,37,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
