Vocals are superb. The heavier tracks are perfectly supported by the ballads which are pure genius - Under the Same Sun, Lonely Nights, Send Me an Angel are beautiful tracks which deserve to be heard by a larger audience than they have had. This album is worth getting for those 3 tracks alone - but in truth - the whole collection doesn't have a bad track on it.\n[Source: Amazon.co.uk]\n\nRelease Year: 2002\nGenre: Heavy Metal/Hard Rock\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
