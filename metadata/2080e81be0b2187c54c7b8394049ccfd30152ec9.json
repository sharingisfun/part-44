RPG-ish Space fun with random loot all day. Check it if you dig open-world ship-shooting stuff and RPG progression. Just unzip the mess and go for it!!\n--------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\nZigfrak is a space-based action RPG, featuring missions, exploration, and crafting. With an emphasis on loot and over-the-top items, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a traditional space sim. Enemy ships explode like loot piÃƒÂ±atas, spewing forth useful pickups.\n\nThe game employs subtle humor to poke light at a dark situation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a human civil war on a galactic scale, complicated by the invasion of technologically superior aliens. During the campaign, players encounter clues and artifacts which could reveal ancient secrets of humanity.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\nCPU Cores: Dual Core\nMinimum RAM: 1 GB\nDirectX Version: 7.0\nGraphics Card RAM: 512 MB\nGraphics Card: 7.0\nGraphics Card Shader Model: 4.0\nSound Card: Required\nCPU Speed: 2.0 GHz\nOperating System: Windows Vista, 32 bit.\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n*Absolutely 100% clean and working!*\n*My upload ain't the best, but I'll seed this forever!*\n*BUY the games you reallllly dig!!!*\n\n**Check my profile for more TPB-exclusive indie games!!!**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2080e81be0b2187c54c7b8394049ccfd30152ec9","amp;dn":"Zigfrak+%28v1.06%29+-%5BGIBZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2080e81be0b2187c54c7b8394049ccfd30152ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,128,232,27,224,178,24,124,84,199,184,57,64,73,204,253,48,21,46,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
