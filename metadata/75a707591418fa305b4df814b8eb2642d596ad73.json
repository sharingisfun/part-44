Novelized from the scenario of F. Lonergan. Profusely illustrated with scenes from the photo play. In his youth, John Hargreaves joins the Black Hundred, a Russian secret service organization. He later abandons the group, moves to the United States, and earns a fortune. When Hargreaves learns that several Black Hundred agents are after him, he withdraws a million dollars from various banks and prepares to flee with his daughter Florence. The Russian agents, led by Countess Olga, kidnap and threaten Florence to blackmail Hargreaves for the money. In the end, however, she is saved by newspaper reporter Jim Norton, who helps to round up the gang and reunites Florence with her father.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75a707591418fa305b4df814b8eb2642d596ad73","amp;dn":"The+Million+Dollar+Mystery+by+Harold+MacGrath+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75a707591418fa305b4df814b8eb2642d596ad73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,167,7,89,20,24,250,48,91,77,248,20,184,235,38,66,213,150,173,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
