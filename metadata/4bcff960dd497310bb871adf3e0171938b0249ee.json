In these burrows, the Viet Cong cached their weapons, tended their wounded, and prepared to strike. They had only one enemy: U.S. soldiers small and wiry enough to maneuver through the guerrillas' narrow domain. \n\nThe brave souls who descended into these hellholes were known as &quot;tunnel rats.&quot; Armed with only pistols and K-bar knives, these men inched their way through the steamy darkness where any number of horrors could be awaiting them--bullets, booby traps, a tossed grenade. Using firsthand accounts from men and women on both sides who fought and killed in these underground battles, authors Tom Mangold and John Penycate provide a gripping inside look at this fearsome combat. The Tunnels of Cu Chi is a war classic of unbearable tension and unforgettable heroes.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Tunnels-Chi-Underground-Battlefields/dp/0891418695&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Tunnels-Chi-Underground-Battlefields/dp/0891418695&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bcff960dd497310bb871adf3e0171938b0249ee","amp;dn":"The+Tunnels+of+Cu+Chi%3A+A+Harrowing+Account+of+America%27s+Tunnel+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bcff960dd497310bb871adf3e0171938b0249ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,207,249,96,221,73,115,16,187,135,26,223,62,1,113,147,139,2,73,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
