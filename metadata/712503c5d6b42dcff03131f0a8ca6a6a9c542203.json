They were a duel-bass guitar/sample-based band that sounded like a mixture of Big Black, Swans and Foetus. Sampler/Trombonist David Ouimet left as a full-time member after recording Consumer Revolt but returned several times to play trombone (along with other members from his band Motherhead Bug). Leading man Tod Ashley went on to form Firewater to further explore the Eastern European influence of the bands last two albums. Keyboardist Jim Coleman began his own musical project called Phylr which was influenced by bass and drum/electronic music. After Tod A. left the remaining members of the band recorded Red Expendables in 1995, which featured a less abrasive sound.\n\ncontains:\nCOP SHOOT COP ALBUMS\n(1989) Headkick Facsimile + Piece Man [EP]\n(1990) Consumer Revolt\n(1991) White Noise\n(1992) Suck City [EP]\n(1993) Ask Questions Later\n(1994) Release\n(1995) Any Day Now [EP]\n(1997) Red Expendables: Red Expendables\n\nJIM FILER COLEMAN (J.
