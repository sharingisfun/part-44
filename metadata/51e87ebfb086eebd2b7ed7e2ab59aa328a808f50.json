There is, however, one category of portraits about which no doubt existsÃ¢â‚¬â€the portrait medals. Their creators were great artists, even though their names may be less familiar than those of mediocre painters, and they worked with deep psychological insight and a realism never attempted in large paintings or sculptures. The disadvantage of such portraits is their small size, which does not allow a close study of the features. Here some of them arc shown in considerable enlargement, and on this scale the faces certainly appear amazing, conceived with a vivid naturalism often bordering on caricature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51e87ebfb086eebd2b7ed7e2ab59aa328a808f50","amp;dn":"Unknown+Renaissance+Portraits+-+Medals+of+Famous+Men+and+Women+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51e87ebfb086eebd2b7ed7e2ab59aa328a808f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,232,126,191,176,134,238,189,43,126,215,226,171,89,170,50,138,128,143,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
