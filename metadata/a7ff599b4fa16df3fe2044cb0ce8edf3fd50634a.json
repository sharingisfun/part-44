(You only need one of these methods).\n\n\nCompressed with 7Zip, Game was tested and works.\n\n\n\nNote: No Ps1 Backup/Game or copy will work unless you have a modded Ps1/Ps2, \n      or if you use a bootdisc like Breaker Pro, you can also use a Game \n      Enhancer/Built-in Mod-Chip which does the same as Breaker Pro for the\n      Ps1. (If using Breaker Pro or Game Enhancer for multi-disc games you'll \n      have to use the swap trick, A method of lifting the spring putting in \n      any original ps1 game releasing spring and waiting till the disc starts \n      spinning faster then quickly swap in your next game disc.

This game plays like an interactive movie. \n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn With Alcohol 120% (Included in Download).\n\nSet DataType to Playstation (Write Method Raw/Dao) and burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden CD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n\n(No CD-RW will not work).\n\n\nAny Problems or Questions Please Post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ff599b4fa16df3fe2044cb0ce8edf3fd50634a","amp;dn":"%5BPsx%5D+Fox+Hunt+%5B3-Disc%5D+%5BNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ff599b4fa16df3fe2044cb0ce8edf3fd50634a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,255,89,155,79,161,109,243,254,32,68,203,12,232,237,243,253,80,99,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
