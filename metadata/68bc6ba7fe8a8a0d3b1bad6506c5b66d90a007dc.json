While her husband King Henry II battles for land across the channel, Eleanor fulfils her duty as acting ruler and bearer of royal children. But she wants to be more than this - if only Henry would let her.\nInstead, Henry belittles and excludes her, falling for a young mistress and leaving Eleanor side-lined and angry. And as her sons become young men, frustrated at Henry's hoarding of power, Eleanor is forced into a rebellion of devastating consequences. She knows how much Henry needs her, but does Henry know himself?\n\n\nOverflowing with scandal, politics, sex, triumphs and tragedies, The Winter Crown is the much-awaited new novel in this trilogy and a rich, compelling story in its own right","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68bc6ba7fe8a8a0d3b1bad6506c5b66d90a007dc","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+Chadwick+-+The+Winter+Crown+%2C+Epub%2C%28Req%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68bc6ba7fe8a8a0d3b1bad6506c5b66d90a007dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,188,107,167,254,138,138,13,59,27,173,101,6,197,182,109,144,160,7,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
