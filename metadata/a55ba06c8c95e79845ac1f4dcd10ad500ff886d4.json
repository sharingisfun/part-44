The album, which represented half a decadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work, was edited by Don Gilmore. Hybrid Theory was a massive commercial success; it sold more than 4.8 million copies during its debut year, earning it the status of best-selling album of 2001, while singles such as \\&quot;Crawling\\&quot; and \\&quot;One Step Closer\\&quot; established themselves as staples among alternative rock radio play lists during the year. Additionally, other singles from the album were featured in films such as Dracula 2000, Little Nicky, and Valentine. Hybrid Theory won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song \\&quot;Crawling\\&quot; and was nominated for two other Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. MTV awarded the band their Best Rock Video and Best Direction awards for \\&quot;In the End\\&quot;. Through the winning of the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance, Hybrid TheoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overall success had catapulted the band into mainstream success.\n\nDuring this time, Linkin Park received many invitations to perform on many high-profile tours and concerts including Ozzfest, Family Values Tour and KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas. The band also formed its own tour, Projekt Revolution, which featured other notable artists such as Cypress Hill, Adema, and Snoop Dogg. Within a yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stretch, Linkin Park had performed at over 320 concerts. The experiences and performances of the precocious band were documented in its first DVD, Frat Party at the Pankake Festival, which debuted in November 2001. Now reunited with former bassist Phoenix, the band began work on a remix album, dubbed Reanimation, which would include works from Hybrid Theory and non-album tracks also. Reanimation debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others. Reanimation claimed the second spot on the Billboard 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week. Hybrid Theory is also in the RIAA\\'s Top 100 Albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55ba06c8c95e79845ac1f4dcd10ad500ff886d4","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Hybrid+Theory+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55ba06c8c95e79845ac1f4dcd10ad500ff886d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,91,160,108,140,149,231,152,69,172,31,77,205,16,173,80,15,248,134,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
