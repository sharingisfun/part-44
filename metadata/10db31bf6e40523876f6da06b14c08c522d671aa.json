Why would you want\n   to do that? Well, the DivX Media Format can change the way you\n   play,create and share digital video.\n\n   Converting your videos to DivX video files can be done in one\n   easy step. Simply drag and drop your videos onto the DivX\n   Converter, choose a DivX profile setting and click ?Convert.?\n   That?s it ? you?re done. Admittedly, that may sound like more\n   than one step, but it?s really just one three-pronged step. Or\n   maybe it?s one full step followed by two small ?baby-steps.?\n   Anyway, it?s really, really easy to create a DivX video.\n\n\n  System Requirements\n+======================-\n\n   PIV 1Ghz or better\n   Windows 2000, XP or Vista\n   DirectX 9\n   64MB RAM\n   20MB free space for application","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10db31bf6e40523876f6da06b14c08c522d671aa","amp;dn":"DivX+Media+Converter+%2B+Serial+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10db31bf6e40523876f6da06b14c08c522d671aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,219,49,191,110,64,82,56,118,246,218,6,177,76,8,197,34,214,113,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
