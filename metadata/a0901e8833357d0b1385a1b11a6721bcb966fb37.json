There are also applications of dynamics measurements on multiple timescales, new developments in NMR data analysis, structure calculation protocols, and solid-state methods. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Molecular BiologyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ series format, each offering detailed laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principle behind the technique, lists of equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0901e8833357d0b1385a1b11a6721bcb966fb37","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Protein+NMR+Techniques+2nd+ed+%28Methods+in+Molecular","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0901e8833357d0b1385a1b11a6721bcb966fb37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,144,30,136,51,53,125,11,19,133,161,177,26,103,33,188,185,102,251,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
