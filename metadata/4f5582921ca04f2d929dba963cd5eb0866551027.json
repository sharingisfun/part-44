Download link provided plus the original package was  updated.  \n  System Requirements:\nOperating system :Windows XP (SP2) / Windows Vista, Windows 7\nProcessor :4.3+ GHz or better\nRAM :1 GB RAM\nFree space on HDD :90 Mb\nVideo :256 MB or higherUsing M.U.G.E.N\nAfter downloading M.U.G.E.N, unzip it into a new folder and double-click mugen.exe to run.\nThe majority of content created for M.U.G.E.N tends to be distributed\nas individual characters, stages or motifs. Assembling a game is as\nsimple as downloading the content of your choice, and configuring\nM.U.G.E.N to know about it.\nM.U.G.E.N is designed to be used by people with little or no\nprogramming experience, but with some artistic talent and patience to\nlearn. Of course, having some programming background does give you a\nbit of a headstart. However, if you are just looking to play with\ndownloaded content, all you need to know is how to unzip files and edit a\ntext file.\nHere's a sampling of features you can find in M.U.G.E.N:\nCustomizable title screen, character select screen, life and bars, game sound effects, fonts and more.Characters can have any number of sounds and sprites of any size limited by your computer's memory.Choose from multiple resolutions, ranging from 320x240 up to full HD at 1920x1080.Cutscenes, intros and endings.\nGame Engine\nUse up to 7 buttons for a character.Regular moves, special moves, super moves, etc.Projectiles and special effects.Move cancels and combos, multi-part moves and throws.What your character can do is defined by a scripting language (and your imagination).\n\n[img]http://neuropod.net/imagehost/uploads/f937f9237a8b7fd3b24fcc3d7d132cd4.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://neuropod.net/imagehost/uploads/42f5cc8719a4dbe6acdf2085c397c77d.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://neuropod.net/imagehost/uploads/e7777ee03e8094ab9650badac5651860.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5582921ca04f2d929dba963cd5eb0866551027","amp;dn":"NARUTO+GAME+MUGEN++2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5582921ca04f2d929dba963cd5eb0866551027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,85,130,146,28,160,79,45,146,157,186,150,60,213,235,8,102,85,16,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
