Mona \n Cher ...  Sissy \n Karen Black ...  Joanne \n Sudie Bond ...  Juanita \n Kathy Bates ...  Stella Mae \n Marta Heflin ...  Edna Louise \n Mark Patton ...  Joe Qualley \n Caroline Aaron ...  Martha \n Ruth Miller ...  Clarissa \n Gena Ramsel ...  Sue Ellen \n Ann Risley ...  Phyllis Marie \n Dianne Turley Travis ...  Alice Ann \n\n\nIt tells the story of a group of women, all members of a James Dean fan club, who meet on the anniversary of his death in the small Texas town in which Giant (1956) was filmed. They experience a day full of revealed secrets and revelatory experiences. The play was a financial failure and was panned by critics, notably Frank Rich in the New York Times, who mercilessly derided the text, direction, acting, and even the set.\n\nBroadway Production\n\nCome Back to the 5 &amp; Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\n\nMartin Beck Theatre, (2/18/1982 - 4/4/1982) \nPreview: Feb 8, 1982   Total Previews: 4 \nOpening: Feb 18, 1982       \nClosing: Apr 4, 1982   Total Performances: 52 \n\nCategory: Play, Original, Broadway\nSetting: The time of the play alternates between September 30, 1975 and 1955.\n\n Cast\nKaren Black  Joanne    \nCher  Sissy    \nSandy Dennis  Mona    \nKathy Bates  Stella May    \nSudie Bond  Juanita    \nMarta Heflin  Edna Louise    \nRuth Miller  Clarissa    \nMark Patton  Joe    \nGena Ramsel  Sue Ellen    \nAnn Risley  Martha    \nDianne Turley Travis  Alice Ann \n\n\nDespite the play's failure, the star power of the cast ensured a movie sale, and the 1982 film was an important turning point in the movie career aspirations of Cher. After trying for several years to be taken seriously as an actress, Cher was regarded as something of a Hollywood joke, until she performed in the stage version of this play, along with Black and Dennis. The strong reviews she received for her stage work paved the way for her to be cast in the film version, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. This success led to her being cast in Silkwood in 1983, for which she received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn the film, Altman frequently uses mirrors as a device for connecting scenes seamlessly between the present and the past. Reflections in mirrors are part of many of the frame compositions in the movie. Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean was Altman's first feature film since the critically-panned Popeye (1980).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc61f5ebb546973694d2c151c2e1b534314f11e3","amp;dn":"Come+Back+to+the+5+and+Dime%2C+Jimmy+Dean+%5B1982%5D++%28LASERDISC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc61f5ebb546973694d2c151c2e1b534314f11e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,97,245,235,181,70,151,54,148,210,193,81,194,225,181,52,49,79,17,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
