It was later released as a single in the U.S where it was also incorporated into the band's stop gap EP Fascination!. The single reached number 8 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was their first number 1 single on the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The EP Fascination! (which is often confused with the single) contained two versions of &quot;(Keep Feeling) Fascination&quot;: the extended mix and an improvisation, both different from the single version.\n\nThe single was designated 'Red' on the Human LeagueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s short lived, self imposed labeling system of 'Blue' for pop songs and 'Red' for dance tracks.\n\nThe music video for &quot;(Keep Feeling) Fascination&quot; was filmed in a semi-derelict area of Newham, London which was due for demolition and redevelopment as part of the widescale redevelopment of Docklands and East London which took place in the early 1980s. The central theme of the video was based on a red dot on a map, which in turn is a real red dot on the ground. The red dot highlights a single house on the apex of a street where the band are playing the song in the front room.\n\nFilmed before the widespread use of CGI for the video the house (which was 1 First Avenue,London E13 8AP) and surrounding area (Junction of 1st Avenue and 3rd Avenue) encompassed by the red dot were painted red for real, including a complete car. The opening scenes establish the landscape from a map before zooming through the front window of the 'red' house, as the band starts the song. The video was conceived and directed by Steve Barron who directed most of the Human League's early 1980s music videos. The band's scenes were all filmed in a studio; Susan Ann Sulley says that the house was still occupied by a family during the painting and filming of the external scenes. The house remained red for a couple of weeks before finally being demolished in mid 1983. The area where the red house stood, today is a grassed area on the junction of 1st and 3rd Avenues.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ffcad5443b05658ae397824d1640e6656ee8a74","amp;dn":"The+Human+League+-+%28Keep+Feeling%29+Fascination","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ffcad5443b05658ae397824d1640e6656ee8a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,252,173,84,67,176,86,88,174,57,120,36,209,100,14,102,86,238,138,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
