As he prepares to celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday, he laments, &amp;#039; I can&amp;#039;t decide if my friends are the best or worst thing that ever happened to me.&amp;#039; The gang includes Benji, the punkish innocent with a penchant for gym bodies; Howie, the psychology grad student who thinks too much and lives too little; Cole, the charismatic actor who accidentally keeps stealing everybody&amp;#039;s guy; Patrick, the cynical quipster, and Taylor, resident drama queen, who, until recently, prided himself on his long-term relationship. Providing sage advice and steady work is Jack, the beloved patriarch whose restaurant is a haven for them all. When tragedy strikes the group, the friendships are put to the test.
