There's no denying that the rise of the private military contractor is transforming the way we wage war. They earn four times more than regular soldiers, act with impunity and - in Iraq - outnumber all non-US soldiers combined. Private Armies follows the training and deployment of these men. From skidding around a racing track, practicing escaping from kidnappers, to dodging bullets in Baghdad, this insider documentary presents an eye-opening look at life as a private soldier.\n\n;;\n\nWATCH:\n\nAuthor Jeremy Scahill on Blackwater\n\nAuthor Jeremy Scahill on the Draft\n\n;;\n\nLEARN MORE:\n\n\nThe official website of Blackwater USA\n\nA collection of Jeremy ScahillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reports on Blackwater from The Nation magazine.\n\nJeremy ScahillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s website contains news and information about his book, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackwater: The Rise of the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Most Powerful Mercenary Army.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSource Watch provides extensive research on the secretive private security company from the Center for Media &amp; Democracy.\n\nStop Blackwater is a citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ campaign aimed at stopping the construction of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlackwater WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ outside of the town of Potrero, California, in east San Diego county.\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79bf7c4154e31e84b805f25b7e84c3e690dd7b1","amp;dn":"Private+Armies-LinkTV-sdtv+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79bf7c4154e31e84b805f25b7e84c3e690dd7b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,155,247,196,21,78,49,232,75,128,95,37,183,232,76,62,105,13,215,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
