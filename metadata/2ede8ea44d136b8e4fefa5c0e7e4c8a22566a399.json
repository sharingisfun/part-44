The Pumas won on their last trip to Murrayfield back in 2009, and in fact have not lost there since their first visit back in 1990. They will be further boosted by a first ever win in the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship in October. However, the Scots edged it 21-19 when the sides met in Cordoba in June. Match commentary is by Alistair Bruce-Ball, Andy Nicol and Phillip Matthews, with Sir Ian McGeechan and Chris Paterson in the studio.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 7.82 GB\nRuntime___: 123 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps 7986Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 CBR 6ch 48KHz 384Kbps\nAudio#2___: MP2 CBR 2ch 48KHz 256Kbps\n\nDropbox folder\nt i n y u r l . c o m / m s z 9 q 9 a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ede8ea44d136b8e4fefa5c0e7e4c8a22566a399","amp;dn":"BBC.Rugby.Union.2014.11.08.Scotland.v.Argentina.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ede8ea44d136b8e4fefa5c0e7e4c8a22566a399","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,222,142,164,77,19,107,142,79,239,165,192,231,228,200,162,37,102,163,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
