The main hero is a Russian soldier, Alyosha Skvortsov, one of the many who made the victory over Fascism possible. He is neither an action movie hero, nor a conqueror. This simple boy, who was panic-stricken at the first sight of an enemy tank, overcomes his fear and manages to hit two enemy machines. However, battle scenes do not take much of the film's time. For his fighting exploits Alyosha is awarded a two-day's leave to visit his mother. He meets many different people on his way and is ready to help everybody. That leaves him just a few minutes to spend with his mother a few words, a hug, and he is off for the front again... to never come back.\n\nCast\nVladimir Ivashov, Zhanna Prokhorenko, Antonina Maximova, Nikolai Kriuchkov, Yevgheny Urbansky\n\nAwards\nPrize for Best Competition Film Program (along with the film &quot;Lady With a Dog&quot;) and Prize for Best Film For Youth at the Cannes IFF, 1960\nGolden Gate Award - the first prize at the San Francisco IFF, 1960\nDavid Donatello Prize for the Best Foreign-Language Film in Italy\nGrand Prize at the London IFF, 1960\nOscar nomination of Valentin Yezhov and Grigory Chukhrai for Best Original Screenplay, 1961\nSpecial features\nPictures and filmography of the film's authors\nCandids from the shooting ground\nAn interview with the director G.
