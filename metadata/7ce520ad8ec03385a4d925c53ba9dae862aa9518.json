The quality of his illustrations needed no explanation beyond that which was obvious at first glance: the sleekly stylized figure work, his masterful command of colors, and the layers and subtext that formed an essential part of his vision. It was a short trip from anonymity to his current status as one of Marvel's most compelling cover artists.\n\nThis lush art book will feature a treasure trove of Marko's cover illustrations Ã¢â‚¬â€ plus sketches, designs and extensive discussion about the process that has made him one of Marvel's most popular artists. In collaboration with the artist himself, and with input from his peers, THE ART OF MARKO DJURDJEVIC will be the kind of deluxe art book you'll be proud to show off to friends and fellow art fans.\n\nRated T\n\n------\n\nJust for laughs, I'm including the infamous Robot6 (ComicBookResources) article from 2011 below.  --STF\n\n------\n\nMarko Djurdjevic ends Marvel deal, blasts editors [Updated]\nby Kevin Melrose\n\nIf you're breathlessly awaiting for more Marvel work from Marko Djurdjevic, you may be disappointed. The acclaimed artist, known for his character designs and for his covers for FF, Daredevil and Thor, revealed last night at FanExpo Canada that he's ended his exclusive contract with the publisher Ã¢â‚¬â€ a split that apparently couldn't come soon enough for Djurdjevic.\n\n&quot;When I get hired for movie work or video game work, I get hired for my creativity,&quot; Djurdjevic said in the ironically named &quot;Team Spirit&quot; panel. &quot;At Marvel, I get hired for what they know sells. It's really just a pigeon hole for an artist.&quot;\n\nAccording to the Comic Book Resources report, softspoken FF artist Steve Epting stood in stark contrast to a joking yet visibly frustrated Djurdjevic, who complained about interference from Marvel editors and repeated requests for revisions without additional pay. &quot;I was fighting with the guys at Marvel about this,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't make people re-work your shit because you can't decide what you want. Either pay or leave.&quot; After showing the audience numerous mock-ups for his redesign of Lady Bullseye Ã¢â‚¬â€ mocking editors' comments in high-pitched tones Ã¢â‚¬â€ Djurdjevic added, &quot;When they would not interfere with my direction, they would get results that would amaze even me.&quot;\n\nHe didn't restrict his criticism to the editors, however. Asked by Epting whether he wished he'd done more interior work at Marvel, Djurdjevic replied, &quot;They never put me with any writers that I liked.&quot; From there, CBR reports, he launched into a tirade about the company and fired a few shots at former Thor writer J. Michael Straczynski, who he said writes &quot;like toilet paper.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce520ad8ec03385a4d925c53ba9dae862aa9518","amp;dn":"THE+MARVEL+ART+OF+MARKO+DJURDJEVIC+%282009%29+%28c2c%29+%28Mal32-MrWoodman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce520ad8ec03385a4d925c53ba9dae862aa9518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,229,32,173,142,192,51,133,164,217,37,197,59,169,218,232,98,170,149,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
