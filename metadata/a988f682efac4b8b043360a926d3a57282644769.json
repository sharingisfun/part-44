One night, Jobs discovered a scruffy British designer toiling away at AppleÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s corporate headquarters, surrounded by hundreds of sketches and prototypes. It was then that Jobs realized he had found a talent who could reverse the companyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s long decline.\n\nThat young designer was Jony Ive. \n\nJony IveÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s collaboration with Jobs would produce some of the worldÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s most iconic technology products, including the iMac, iPod, iPad, and iPhone. The designs have not only made Apple a hugely valuable company, theyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve overturned entire industries, built a loyal fan base, and created a globally powerful brand. Along the way, Jony Ive has become the worldÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s leading technology innovator, won countless design awards, earned a place on the 2013 Time 100 list, and was even knighted for his ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£services to design and enterprise.ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥\n\nYet despite his triumphs, little is known about the shy and soft-spoken whiz whom Jobs referred to as his ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£spiritual partnerÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ at Apple. Jony Ive reveals the true story of AppleÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s real innovator-in-chief.\n\nLeander Kahney, the bestselling author of Inside SteveÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Brain, offers a detailed portrait of a creative genius. He shows us how Jony Ive went from an English art school student with dyslexia to the man whose immense insights have altered the pattern of our lives. From his early interest in industrial design, fostered by his designer father, through his education at Newcastle Polytechnic and meteoric rise at Apple, we discover the principles and practices that he developed to become the designer of his generation.\n\nBased on interviews with Jony IveÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s former colleagues and KahneyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s own familiarity with the world of Apple, this book gives insight into how Jony Ive (now senior vice president of design) has redefined the ways in which we work, entertain, and communicate with one another.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a988f682efac4b8b043360a926d3a57282644769","amp;dn":"%5Bepub%5D+Jony+Ive+-+The+Genius+Behind+Apple%27s+Greatest+Products+%28L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a988f682efac4b8b043360a926d3a57282644769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,136,246,130,239,172,75,139,4,51,96,169,38,211,165,114,130,100,71,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
