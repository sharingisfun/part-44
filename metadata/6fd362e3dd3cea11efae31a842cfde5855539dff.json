Sharktopus should delight you.\n\nLike all their other (fallen) star-studded beast pics, this SyFy flick is filled with more cheese than a Pizza Hut stuffed crust pizza. This time around they've corralled Eric Roberts (do these guys' agents call SyFy to try and get their careers boosted. now that these beast-cheesers are so popular?) as the what-ever-happened-to? big name draw. Roberts plays a scientist who's created a shark/octopus monster mash-up for the Coast Guard-like folks to try and help them curb the offshore drug smugglers. Naturally things go wrong and loads of people get squished and eaten by the behemoth beast.\n\nSCREENS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2730/vlcsnap2010101009h16m13.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2730/vlcsnap2010101009h16m13.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4047/vlcsnap2010101009h17m09.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4047/vlcsnap2010101009h17m09.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9180/vlcsnap2010101009h18m14.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/9180/vlcsnap2010101009h18m14.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND BE PATIENT, MY UPLOAD SPEED IS CAPPED :(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd362e3dd3cea11efae31a842cfde5855539dff","amp;dn":"Sharktopus+2010+HDTV+XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd362e3dd3cea11efae31a842cfde5855539dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,211,98,227,221,60,234,17,239,174,49,168,66,207,222,88,85,83,157,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
