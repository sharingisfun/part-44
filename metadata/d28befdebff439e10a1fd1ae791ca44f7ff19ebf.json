Instead, it aims to fill the need for a basic, streamlined editor for those times when you just feel the need to doodle.\n\n\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s New in This Release:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Added in 1.1:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fill tool completely rewritten, resulting in a significant speed gain\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Limited undo stack to 10 undos (reducing chance for memory overflow)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· SUBMITTED: Grid overlay now available\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Zooming image will not cause funny scrolling to occur\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· By default, images created by Paintbrush will open in Paintbrush in the Finder\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Bomb tool animation can be immediately completed by pressing ESC\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Preliminary support for Shift key in Selection tool\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Text insertion uses front color, automatically opens font panel\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Color accuracy has been improved (now using calibrated instead of device colors)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Added button to switch foreground and background colors\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Toolbox shortcut key changed to better represent functionality\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fixed in 1.1:\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· REQUESTED: No longer uses wrong size when opening certain JPEGs\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· REQUESTED: Second click on either color well hides panel, avoiding confusion\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Pastes in correct bottom-left corner when zoomed\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Changing colors during bomb animation will not change the color being used\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Undo no longer makes duplicates of image clippings when used with Selection tool\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Paste no longer occasionally places image in Toolbox instead of the document window\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Scrollbars in correct location after zoom, opening large images...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28befdebff439e10a1fd1ae791ca44f7ff19ebf","amp;dn":"Paintbrush+1.1+for+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28befdebff439e10a1fd1ae791ca44f7ff19ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,139,239,222,191,244,57,225,10,31,209,174,121,28,164,79,127,241,158,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
