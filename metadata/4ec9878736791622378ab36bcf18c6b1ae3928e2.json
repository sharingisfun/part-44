Sammonds, J. M. T. Thompson, &quot;Advances in Earth Science: From Earthquakes to Global Warming&quot;\n\nEnglish | ISBN: 186094762X | 2007 | PDF | 344 pages \n\nAdvances in Earth Science outlines the latest developments and new research directions currently being made world-wide in the earth sciences. It contains invited and refereed articles by leading younger researchers on their cutting-edge research, but aimed at a general scientific audience. This exciting volume explains how powerful methodologies such as satellite remote sensing and supercomputing simulations are now profoundly changing research in the earth sciences; how the earth system is increasingly being viewed in a holistic way, linking the atmosphere, ocean and solid earth; and how the societal impact of the research in the earth sciences has never been more important. Published by Imperial College Press in collaboration with the Royal Society of London, the book features many articles originating from invited papers published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Eleven of the distinguished contributors hold prestigious Royal Society Research Fellowships.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec9878736791622378ab36bcf18c6b1ae3928e2","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Earth+Science%3A+From+Earthquakes+to+Global+Warming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec9878736791622378ab36bcf18c6b1ae3928e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,201,135,135,54,121,22,34,55,138,179,107,207,24,198,177,174,57,40,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
