Continuing a trend that would conclude with its fifth studio release, the lineup for the album was changed from the previous one, with Jan Rubach replacing Uwe Wessel on bass and Thomas Nack replacing Uli Kusch on drums.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2002 with additional tracks. The 2002 version was released again in 2010 by Cooking Vinyl Records as part of a 2CD set with the 2002 version of Land of the Free.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Tribute to the Past&quot;   \t \t                  5:04\n2. \t&quot;No Return&quot;   \t \t                                  4:06\n3. \t&quot;Last Before the Storm&quot;   \t \t                  4:29\n4. \t&quot;The Cave Principle&quot;   \t \t                          6:51\n5. \t&quot;Future Madhouse&quot;   \t \t                          4:07\n6. \t&quot;Gamma Ray&quot; (Birth Control cover) \t\t          5:20\n7. \t&quot;Insanity &amp; Genius&quot;   \t \t                          4:30\n8. \t&quot;18 Years&quot;   \tScheepers \t\t                  5:23\n9. \t&quot;Your TÃƒÂ¸rn Is Over[d]&quot;   \t                          3:53\n10. \t&quot;Heal Me&quot;   \t\t                                  7:32\n11. \t&quot;Brothers&quot;   \t\t                                  5:15\n\n+ (2002) re-release\n\t\n12. \t&quot;Gamma Ray (extended version)[b]&quot; (Birth Control cover)   7:26\n13. \t&quot;Exciter[c]&quot; (Judas Priest cover) \t\t          5:01\n14. \t&quot;Save Us (live)&quot;   \t\t                          5:41\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0915a0dd483819c0730357836a1b7affccd8fb27","amp;dn":"Gamma+Ray-1993-Insanity+And+Genius+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0915a0dd483819c0730357836a1b7affccd8fb27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,21,160,221,72,56,25,192,115,3,87,131,106,27,122,255,204,216,251,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
