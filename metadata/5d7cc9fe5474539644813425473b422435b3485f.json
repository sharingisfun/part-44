For over 10 years, they&amp;#039;ve been some of rap&amp;#039;s most reliable track masters, hooking up tasty bits of musical treats. Their style has remained relatively unchanged, kept simple with infectious loops, crackling breakbeats, and party-anthem lyrics that don&amp;#039;t run deep but don&amp;#039;t have too. But with each new album, the &amp;#039;Nuts wear their own style out from the recycling. Sure, the music still has flavor--check the darting flute loop in &quot;Mayonnaise&quot; or bounce to the energetic vocal chorus on &quot;No Escapin&amp;#039; This&quot;--but Psycho Les and Juju have played themselves out like the XFL: all style, no substance. They&amp;#039;re far from the only ones kickin&amp;#039; juvenile, misogynistic lyrics and lifeless boasting, but after four albums of the same, there&amp;#039;s just no creative spark to relight their fire. I&amp;#039;m not sure what their title means, but at this point, I&amp;#039;d rather not take it or squeeze it. Just leave it. --Oliver Wang\n\n\n\n1. Intro \t\n2.
