Stranded at John F. Kennedy International Airport with a passport from nowhere, he is unauthorized to actually enter the United States and must improvise his days and nights in the terminal??s international transit lounge until the war at home is over.\n\nAs the weeks and months stretch on, Viktor finds the compressed universe of the terminal to be a richly complex world of absurdity, generosity, ambition, amusement, status, serendipity and even romance with a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). But Viktor has long worn out his welcome with airport official Frank Dixon, who considers him a bureaucratic, glitch, a problem he cannot control but wants desperately to erase..\n\nOther features\n\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access\n\nFULL DVD5\n\nCOMPRESI??N: anyDVD+DVDRemakePro+DVDRebuilder+HC(2pas)\n- Overall Bitrate : 3.933Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.557.392KB\n\nMore info in SOLODVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb58d3c711580ca5483ae246e0ec9b888336948","amp;dn":"The+Terminal+%5B+La+Terminal%5D+%28Tom+Hanks%29%5BEngli%2C+Spanis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb58d3c711580ca5483ae246e0ec9b888336948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,181,141,60,113,21,128,202,84,131,174,36,110,14,201,184,136,51,105,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
