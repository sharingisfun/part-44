As it is, its mere existence as a mid-priced double CD, alongside the presence of the two best-of compilations from MCA and Mercury, makes collecting the best Dell Vikings material extremely complicated. Collectables Records got access to the complete recordings that the original group made for Fee Bee Records, which covers their history from 1956 through 1957, overlapping with the history of the Mercury version of the group. This includes the hit version of &quot;Come Go With Me,&quot; as well as &quot;Whispering Bells&quot; (both of which appear on MCA's best-of in those very same versions) and their other early tracks. Collectables also got access to an extraordinary body of outtakes -- a magnificent fast version of &quot;I'm Spinning&quot; that's completely different from the version that appears on both the MCA and Mercury best-of discs. There are distinctive outtakes of &quot;Willette&quot; and oddities such as the Joey Biscoe single &quot;What Made Maggie Run,&quot; on which the group sang backup in a hurried attempt to get them out before the public again after that first hit. More important are tracks like &quot;Uh Uh Baby,&quot; a fast jump number that shows the group at about its rockingest and nimblest, with a killer guitar solo courtesy of Joe Lopes. Other highlights include radiant outtakes of &quot;Girl, Girl&quot; and &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (done a cappella), little snippets of session chatter (amazing the stuff survived 40 years), and rehearsal and audition versions of the group's songs and generally the fullest account possible of the history of the Fee Bee Records version of the group that you'll ever see. \n\n\nDell Vikings - For Collectors Only\n\nCD 1\n\n01 Come Go With Me\n02 When I Come Home\n03 I'm Spinning\n04 Over the Rainbow\n05 Girl, Girl\n06 Uh Uh Baby (aka Baby Let Me Be)\n07 How Can I Find True Love\n08 Willette\n09 Cold Feet\n10 Marguetite\n11 There I Go\n12 What Made Maggie Run\n13 Little Girl\n14 Senorita\n15 Don't Be a Fllo\n16 I'm Spinning\n17 Down By the Stream\n18 Yours\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01 Whispering Bells\n02 You Send Me\n03 Woke Up This Morning\n04 In the Still of the Night\n05 Little Billy Boy\n06 Willette\n07 Cry Baby\n08 How Can I Find True Love\n09 The White Cliffs of Dover\n10 You Said You Love Me\n11 I Want to Marry You\n12 Cold Feet\n13 Watching the Moon\n14 Down in Bermuda\n15 Understand\n16 Heaven and Paradise\n17 Girl Girl\n18 Come Go With Me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c22d30ad5791d692178451aef0991511ab2eaf9","amp;dn":"%28R%26B+DooWop%29+Dell+Vikings+-+For+Collectors+Only+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c22d30ad5791d692178451aef0991511ab2eaf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,34,211,10,213,121,29,105,33,120,69,26,239,9,145,81,26,178,234,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
