It was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and\nwas released in the United States on October 21, 2005 and in the United\nKingdom on December 2, 2005.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, Doom was released for the Unrated DVD version. The\nunrated DVD has a running time of 1 hour 53 minutes, 8 minutes longer than the\nrated release.[citation needed] Doom was released on Blu-ray Disc on February\n10, 2009\n\nAfter option deals with Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures lapsed, id\nSoftware signed a deal with Warner Bros. with the stipulation that the movie be\ngreenlit within 12 months. Warner Bros. lost the rights, which were subsequently\ngiven back to Universal Pictures who started production in 2004.\n\n\nThe film is set on Mars in the year 2046, in the Union Aerospace Corporation\n(UAC)-owned Olduvai Research Facility where scientists are running for their\nlives. One by one, they are grabbed and pulled into the darkness by some\nunseen monster, screaming in. Carmack (Robert Russell), escapes into a sealed\nroom and sends an SOS rescue signal warning about a Level 5 security breach\nin the top security lab. While he is saying this the door behind him is being torn\nopen. He turns around and sees something through the gap in the door.\n\nOn Earth, a team of eight Marines have their leave interrupted by Sarge (Dwayne\nJohnson), who has received a call from Olduvai. The Mars station is immediately\nquarantined and the 79 UAC employees on Mars are not allowed to return to\nEarth. As the men suit up, Sarge pulls aside one of his men, John &quot;Reaper&quot;\nGrimm (Karl Urban), and asks him not to go because his sister is on the station.\nReaper suits up anyway, and their team is deployed to Mars via a teleportation\ndevice called the Ark, located at Area 51. The Ark was discovered in 2026 (as\ntold by opening credits narrator Rosamund Pike), and for twenty years scientists\nhave been trying to discover who built it, and why. Upon arriving at the Mars\nresearch facility of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), they meet an early\nvictim of the Ark system, Pinky (Dexter Fletcher), who &quot;went to one galaxy while\nhis ass went to another&quot; (his lower torso now a 2-wheeled engine resembling a\nSegway) during an Ark teleportation event. They meet up with Dr. Samantha\nGrimm (Rosamund Pike), Reaper's sister, who explains the situation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a01e2441074181&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/a01e2441074181&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 5.19 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 52mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 6596 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;cd85a4aaa58d81f9e3fd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 4 frames\nBit rate                         : 4929 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 5080 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\n\nAudio\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : DTS\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 1536 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\nJacket &amp; DVD  @  600dpi\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35a227edd17c7448960fcc3061051da205ab576","amp;dn":"Doom+-+Unrated+1080p+HDRip+%5B+x264+-+dts+-+mkv+%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35a227edd17c7448960fcc3061051da205ab576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,90,34,126,221,23,199,68,137,96,252,195,6,16,81,218,32,90,181,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
