It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the other work ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon, and is the second oldest extant work of Western literature, the Iliad being the oldest. It is believed to have been composed near the end of the 8th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.\n\nThe poem mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus (known as Ulysses in Roman myths) and his journey home after the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War.[2] In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the Mnesteres (Greek: ÃŽÅ“ÃŽÂ½ÃŽÂ·ÃÆ’Ãâ€žÃ¡Â¿â€ Ãï¿½ÃŽÂµÃâ€š) or Proci, who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage.\n\nIt continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world. Many scholars believe that the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an aoidos (epic poet/singer), perhaps a rhapsode (professional performer), and was more likely intended to be heard than read.[1] The details of the ancient oral performance, and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The Odyssey was written in a poetic dialect of GreekÃ¢â‚¬â€a literary amalgam of Aeolic Greek, Ionic Greek, and other Ancient Greek dialectsÃ¢â‚¬â€and comprises 12,110 lines of dactylic hexameter.[3][4] Among the most noteworthy elements of the text are its non-linear plot, and the influence on events of choices made by women and serfs, besides the actions of fighting men. In the English language as well as many others, the word odyssey has come to refer to an epic voyage.\n\nThe Odyssey has a lost sequel, the Telegony, which was not written by Homer. It was usually attributed in Antiquity to Cinaethon of Sparta, but in one source was said to have been stolen from Musaeus by Eugamon or Eugammon of Cyrene (see Cyclic poets).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a77ea6e70312034721357b24800a45d412f6a6d4","amp;dn":"Homer+-+The+Odyssey+%5BV8%5D+Read+by+John+Lee%2C+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a77ea6e70312034721357b24800a45d412f6a6d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,126,166,231,3,18,3,71,33,53,123,36,128,10,69,212,18,246,166,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
