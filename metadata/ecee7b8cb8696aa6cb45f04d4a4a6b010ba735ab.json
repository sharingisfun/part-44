Working with thoroughbreds in Kentucky, Shawn takes a liking to a yearling named Seabiscuit, and fights to convince the horse's owner that the tiny horse with big knees will become a top-notch racehorse. Meanwhile, Margaret begins a tentative relationship with jockey Ted Knowles, but is haunted by her brother's death in a steeplechase spill.\n\nShirley Temple\nBarry Fitzgerald","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecee7b8cb8696aa6cb45f04d4a4a6b010ba735ab","amp;dn":"The.Story.of.Seabiscuit.%281949%29.DVDRip.x264.AC-3.MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecee7b8cb8696aa6cb45f04d4a4a6b010ba735ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,238,123,140,184,105,106,166,203,69,240,77,74,74,107,1,11,167,53,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
