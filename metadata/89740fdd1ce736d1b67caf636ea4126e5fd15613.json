Featuring collaborations from the likes of Lovefoxx of CSS, Josh Homme from Queens Of the Stone Age and folk legend Linda Thompson, the album could see the band treading pastures new with pop wunderkid BjÃƒÂ¶rn Yttling [Peter, BjÃƒÂ¶rn and John] and Paul Epworth (Bloc Party) handling most of the production duties.\nThe duet with Lovefoxxx, ?I Love To Hurt (You Love To Be Hurt)? is described as a being ?full of shivering electro pulses and tense, claustrophobic rhythms?, while other tracks will feature the band?s trademark soul, electronica and rock n? roll.\n?If you hear this new record of ours from start to finish,? explains Bobby Gillespie, ?and you hear all the different sounds and styles and moods, atmospheres and instrumentation that we use, it&amp;#039;s different from the last record and different from the record before that. You know, there&amp;#039;s not one set Primal Scream song where it&amp;#039;s verse-bridge-chorus-middle-eight. But this album is more like a pop record, more like classic songwriting.?\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89740fdd1ce736d1b67caf636ea4126e5fd15613","amp;dn":"Primal+Scream+-+Beautiful+Future+%5Bmp3-vbr-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89740fdd1ce736d1b67caf636ea4126e5fd15613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,116,15,221,28,231,54,209,182,124,175,99,110,164,18,110,95,209,86,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
