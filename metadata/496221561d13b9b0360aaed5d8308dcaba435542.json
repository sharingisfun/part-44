Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father, Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev), has just died, sees this and begins building a similar weapon. Six months later, Stark has used his Iron Man armor to help maintain world peace. He re-institutes the Stark Expo in Flushing Meadows to continue his father Howard's legacy. Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) demands that Stark turn over the Iron Man technology to the government. Stark refuses, claiming that foreign nations and business competitors are decades away from successfully recreating his achievements, and that the armor is in fact his own property. The palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he has failed to find a substitute. Growing increasingly despondent and reckless due to his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) CEO of Stark Industries, and replaces her with Stark employee Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Vanko attacks Stark while racing at the Circuit de Monaco, using an arc reactor of his own powering whip-like energy weapons. Stark defeats Vanko with the aid of his portable briefcase armor. He learns that Vanko is the son of his father's old partner, Anton Vanko. Anton collaborated with Howard on the first arc reactor, but was deported to his native Soviet Union following his attempts to profit from the technology and died in poverty, explaining Vanko's desire for revenge on the Stark family. Rival defense contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) fakes Vanko's death and recruits him to perfect a line of armored combat suits to upstage Stark.\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease date: 30 April 2010 (UK)\n\ncast\n\n* Robert Downey Jr.\n* Gwyneth Paltrow\n* Don Cheadle\n* Scarlett Johansson\n* Mickey Rourke\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Iron Man 2 720p BRrip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 2236.61 MiB\nDuration: 2h 7mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 453 Kbps\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 114 r1913 5fd3dce\nAverage video bitrate: [/b]\n[b]Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97869934160163065338.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/97869934160163065338.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44541973106361724003.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44541973106361724003.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68672869408439666475.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/68672869408439666475.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03314842435257072790.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/03314842435257072790.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/08922675494790104530.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/08922675494790104530.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57169138152545891475.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/57169138152545891475.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496221561d13b9b0360aaed5d8308dcaba435542","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+2+720p+BRrip+x264+acc+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496221561d13b9b0360aaed5d8308dcaba435542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,98,33,86,29,19,185,176,54,10,174,213,216,48,141,202,186,67,85,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
