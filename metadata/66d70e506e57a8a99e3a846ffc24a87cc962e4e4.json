The first was with Danny Choo and Megurine Luka's voice actress; the second was a rather disappointing non-announcement about Miku USA's release. Basically: Kaito V3 will come out first, and he sounds sexy as hell, while Miku's English has a long way to go. Credit if you use these would be very nice, but if you don't credit, well I can't really get butthurt after putting it on TPB now can I? Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d70e506e57a8a99e3a846ffc24a87cc962e4e4","amp;dn":"NY+Comic-Con+Vocaloid+Panel+info+for+Mukesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d70e506e57a8a99e3a846ffc24a87cc962e4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,215,14,80,110,87,168,169,158,58,132,111,252,36,168,124,201,98,228,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
