Cottonbelly,\nregrouped in a U.K. recording studio in June and were recording and mixing into\nOctober.\n\nThe eponymous first single has put us at ease. It's a narcotic skank with intro\nhorns that remind us of Hov's &quot;Encore&quot; and a guitar scratch smoothed by Sade's\ninimitable cool voice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5e29b71b0256726a00b1bb5bb0e3ce47dd4380","amp;dn":"Sade-+Soldier+of+Love+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c5e29b71b0256726a00b1bb5bb0e3ce47dd4380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,94,41,183,27,2,86,114,106,0,177,187,91,176,227,206,71,221,67,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
