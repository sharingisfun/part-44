But, while it lasted less than a year, its aftermath would shape the course of history for decades to come.\n\nIn this comprehensive and epic account, John-Allen Price explores how this short but far-reaching war came to be, bringing the men who shaped history to life. Price examines the Franco-Prussian War and its world, from the seeds of the war in the Age of Napoleon to the Paris Commune, and the aftershocks that led to a century of slaughter, a war to end all wars, and an even greater war after that.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJohn-Allen Price's The War that Changed the World is a brilliantly written and exhaustively researched masterwork. With all the attention to detail one would expect of Keegan or Ambrose, Price has created a stunningly entertaining and thorough examination of an historical era which shaped the conflicts of the 20th and 21st Centuries. Price's examination of the Franco-Prussian war is engrossing, entertaining and delightfully readableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½presented with a historian's eye for detail and a novelist's ear for story. Students of military history pass this book by at their peril.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n- New York Times Bestselling Author Michael A.
