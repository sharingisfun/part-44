But only ruins lie outside the City, remnants of a society destroyed by solar storms decades earlier.\n\nThe sectors surrounding Eden house the corrupt, the criminalÃ¢â‚¬â€œmen like Jasper McCray, bootlegger and cage fighter. Jas clawed his way up from nothing to stand at the right hand of Sector FourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruthless leader, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll defend the OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Kane gang with his life. But no fight ever prepared him for the exiled City girl who falls at his feet.\n\nHer innocence is undeniable, but so is their intense sexual attraction, and soon theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re crossing every boundary Noelle barely knew she had. But if she wants to belong to Jas, first sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to open herself to the gang, to a dangerous world of sex, lust and violence. A world where passion is power, and freedom is found in submission.\n\nBook 2: Beyond Control (Beyond #2) by Kit Rocha (March 19th 2013)\n\nShe refuses to be owned.\n\nAlexa Parrino escaped a life of servitude and survived danger on the streets to become one of the most trusted, influential people in Sector Four, where the OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Kanes rule with a hedonistic but iron fist. Lex has been at the top for years, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost nothing she wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do for the gangÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and for its leader. Lie, steal, killÃ¢â‚¬â€but she bows to no one, not even Dallas OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Kane.\n\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll settle for nothing less.\n\nDallas fought long and hard to carve a slice of order out of the chaos of the sectors. Dangers both large and small threaten his people, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle. His liquor business is flourishing, and new opportunities fuel his ambition. Lex could help him expand his empire, something he wants almost as much as he wants her. And no one says no to the king of Sector Four.\n\nFalling into bed is easy, but their sexual games are anything but casual. Attraction quickly turns to obsession, and their careful dance of heady dominance and sweet submission uncovers a need so deep, so strong, it could crush them both.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5251dc966a9df82b3fa40d1e6bf7384b53fd85b","amp;dn":"Beyond+Series+%281-2%29+by+Kit+Rocha+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5251dc966a9df82b3fa40d1e6bf7384b53fd85b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,37,29,201,102,169,223,130,179,250,64,209,230,191,115,132,181,63,216,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
