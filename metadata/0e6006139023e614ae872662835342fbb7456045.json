The addition of co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May completed the Top Gear dream team and ratings soared as viewers tuned in to see the latest Star in a Reasonably Priced Car, arguments over the Cool Wall and Power Laps by the mysterious Stig. Top Gear has long attracted criticism for its dangerous stunts and the presenters' controversial opinions, but thankfully 'the Hamster' made a full recovery and Top Gear has continued to pull in massive audiences across the world. This is the full story of the unstoppable rise of Clarkson, Hammond, May and The Stig - and how they have transformed an ordinary programme about cars into one of the most famous and best-loved TV programmes of the 21st century. \n\n\nThe author\n\nMartin Roach is a Number One best-selling author who has written scores of books on celebrity, music, youth culture and fashion.
