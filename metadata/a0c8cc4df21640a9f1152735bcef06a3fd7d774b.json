For anyone who has seen BB Africa you will know it is entirely in English. This series started a while ago and they are already on Day 40. I will probably put up 2 or 3 episodes a day until it is caught up. With US and UK currently running and Australia scheduled to start July 29th it may be Big Brother overload. You can always save it for later. With all these going on PLEASE HELP SEED! Thank you \n\n*** P.S. I think days 5, 6 and 18 are missing ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c8cc4df21640a9f1152735bcef06a3fd7d774b","amp;dn":"Big.Brother.Africa.8.launch+%28ENGLISH%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c8cc4df21640a9f1152735bcef06a3fd7d774b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,200,204,77,242,22,64,169,241,21,39,53,188,239,6,163,253,125,119,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
