So, when an opportunity comes along for village girl Lynn to be kidnapped and enslaved by a ruthless pirate queen, she takes full advantage of it. But Darren is neither as ruthless nor as piratical as she appears at first glance- and Lynn's not exactly what she seems to be, either. In between encounters with old girlfriends, a slow death involving marmalade, and bounty hunters with no sense of humour, Lynn and her new mistress attempt to work out exactly what they are to each other- and who's in charge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593feab0ed7868b9b73239b6d9e4e6e0c5861550","amp;dn":"FF+Zipplic+-+Shell+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593feab0ed7868b9b73239b6d9e4e6e0c5861550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,63,234,176,237,120,104,185,183,50,57,182,217,228,230,224,197,134,21,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
