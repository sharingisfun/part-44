He is the founder of Ricky MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n Foundation (in Spanish FundaciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Ricky Martin) a non-profit charity organization.\n\nIn 2008, he became a single father of twin boys, Matteo and Valentino.\n\nAfter several years as a major star in Spanish-speaking countries, Martin prepared his first English album in 1999. The self-titled album contained material by producers such as Desmond Child, Diane Warren, William Orbit, George Noriega and his longtime childhood friend (producer/singer) Robi Draco Rosa. The album also featured special guests Madonna (on the Spanish-English duet &quot;Be Careful (Cuidado con mi CorazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n)&quot;) and Meja (Private Emotion). As Turkey was one of the countries where Martin's popularity was at its peak, he sang the song with Sertab Erener, Turkish winner of the 2003 Eurovision Song Contest, instead of Meja in Turkish versions of the album.\n\nThe first and most prominent single was &quot;Livin' la Vida Loca,&quot; which reached number one in many countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Guatemala, Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and South Africa. He followed up with the hit &quot;She's All I Ever Had&quot; which peaked at #2 on The Billboard Hot 100. This album became one of the top-selling albums of 1999, and was certified 7 times platinum, selling over 22 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a456985568a79187b60e12072fde456df95b740d","amp;dn":"Ricky+Martin+-+Shake+Your+Bon+Bon++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a456985568a79187b60e12072fde456df95b740d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,86,152,85,104,167,145,135,182,14,18,7,47,222,69,109,249,91,116,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
