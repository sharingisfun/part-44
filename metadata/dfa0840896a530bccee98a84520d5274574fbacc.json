Rasputin \n&gt;\n&gt; Plot:\n&gt;\n&gt; Freebird is an independent British comedy that uses the world of motorcycles and rock music as its backdrop.\n\n&gt; Fred (Gary Stretch), Tyg (Geoff Bell) and Grouch (Phil Daniels), three London motorcycle couriers, set off\n&gt; from London in search of an elusive hippy and his cannabis farm in the Welsh mountains. Fred has found himself\n&gt; making a promise to his old friend The Chairman (Peter Bowles) that whatever situations arise he will not return\n&gt; empty-handed. What was originally intended as a nice weekend in the country becomes a mission.\n&gt; Grouch has also made a promise: come Monday morning hell be moving himself and his belongings into\n&gt; his new found love Lucindas flat, and finally making an attempt at the world of serious relationships.\n&gt; As for Tyg: no such pact. This is a man whos never been further than the outskirts of London, and as\n&gt; far as hes concerned an industrial unit near Heathrow Airport is pretty much the back of beyond. No, \n&gt; Tygs just out for fun: to explore the world; to broaden his horizons; to lose any ignorance and soak \n&gt; up the hospitality of another nation.\n&gt; But what are those wild beast noises coming from the woods? And why is the area thronging with \n&gt; revenge-seeking biker gangs? Was that really a seven-foot, lovesick, masked wrestler in the pub?\n&gt; Can the mysterious hippy really see into the future? Perhaps its all just something to do with all \n&gt; those wild mushrooms our intrepid couriers had for breakfast.\n&gt; Its a three and a half hour journey from London to the Welsh\n&gt;  Mountains but for Fred, Tyg and Grouch its just about to turn into the trip of a lifetime. \n&gt;\n&gt; BE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n&gt;\n&gt; DOWNLOAD YOUR DUQA FILES FROM DUQA ACCOUNTS\n&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/DUQA-TEAM/&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ENJOY!\n&gt;\n&gt; CLIP\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://0-a.mymovies.net/player/default.asp?TRID=3685&amp;filmid=7116&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://0-a.mymovies.net/player/default.asp?TRID=3685&amp;filmid=7116&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfa0840896a530bccee98a84520d5274574fbacc","amp;dn":"Freebird+.%5B2008%5D.DVDRIP.XVID.%5BEng%5D-DUQA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfa0840896a530bccee98a84520d5274574fbacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,160,132,8,150,165,48,188,206,233,138,132,82,13,82,116,87,79,186,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
