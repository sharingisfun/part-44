They were allegedly drunk &amp; on speed, but this music is way ahead of its time. Sounds like the product derived by taking lots of acid, sort of like Blue Cheer.\n&lt;P&gt;\nAnyway, the band was forgotten but saw a resurrection in 1999 at WFMU's infamous &quot;Cavestomp&quot; retro concerts.

Might have trouble getting this torrent going, probably glitch with my provider, please be patient.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e062db2ddfd2922e48779075d2b3e821a196cc9a","amp;dn":"Black+Monk+Time+%281966+US+Psychedelic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e062db2ddfd2922e48779075d2b3e821a196cc9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,98,219,45,223,210,146,46,72,119,144,117,210,179,232,33,161,150,204,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
