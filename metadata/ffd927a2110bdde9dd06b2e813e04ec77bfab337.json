It was released in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2010 by A&amp;M Records (under Polydor) and in the United States on 7 December 2010 by Mercury Records. Duffy worked almost exclusively with Albert Hammond Snr. on the album, with all but one of the album's songs being written by Hammond and Duffy. Four of the songs received additional or co-production by Stuart Price. Music is also provided by The Roots and Questlove. Musically, the album follows the soul stylings of her first album Rockferry (2008), although Duffy drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, including disco and soft rock, and was compared to pop singers like Kylie Minogue. It has been said that Duffy wrote the album in three weeks, although recording sessions lasted between 2009 and 2010.  The album received mixed reviews, with critics stating that Duffy faltered outside of her comfort zone, although it was called a &quot;proper sophomore effort&quot; and &quot;Effortlessly&quot;, and was often compared to Rockferry, in terms of both commercial and critical performance. Vocally, Duffy's falsetto and vibrato were both criticised and praised, being called &quot;delicious to some and cloying to others.&quot; Commercially, it did not replicate Duffy's success with her debut, reaching just number seventy-two on the US Billboard 200. Nevertheless, Endlessly reached the top ten in Denmark, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It has been certified gold in three European countries thus far.  The only single from Endlessly, titled &quot;Well, Well, Well&quot;, did not perform well on national charts, and was only a modest European success, reaching a peak of thirty-seven on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and number forty-one in the UK. The single features a rhythm section by United States hip hop group The Roots. Duffy promoted the album extensively throughout the world, performing on many television shows and conducting an array of print interviews. A live extended play (EP) of songs from the album was released in Germany in 2011 and plans for a concert tour are listed as &quot;coming soon&quot; on Duffy's website. However, since releasing the album, it has been announced that Duffy is taking an extended break from the music industry to work on her third studio album, and the planned second single from Endlessly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;My Boy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was cancelled, though a single mix of the title track was digitally released.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] My Boy\n[02] Too Hurt To Dance\n[03] Keeping My Baby\n[04] Well Well Well\n[05] Don't Forsake Me\n[06] Endlessly\n[07] Breath Away\n[08] Lovestruck\n[09] Girl\n[10] Hard For The Heart\n\n\tCD Play Time - 00h:33m:40s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 238mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
