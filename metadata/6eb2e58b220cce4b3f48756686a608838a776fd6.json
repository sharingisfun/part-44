Each scenario follows one of three main protagonists - Leon S. Kennedy,\nChris Redfield and Jake Muller. The player characters from each scenario will have their own partners which are\ncontrolled by either the computer AI or another human player via local or online multiplayer. When playing in\nsingle player, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time and inventories are now kept \nseparate from each other.[5] A fourth scenario is unlocked after the player has finished the other three,\nin which the player controls Ada Wong (without a partner).[5] The game also features the Mercenaries mode,\nwhere players fight hordes of enemies, and the Agent Hunt mode which allows players to\ntake control of random enemies in other people's games.\n\nMore info and support here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=18587.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=18587.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe are looking for nice coders\nWe are looking for seeders\nWe are looking for people who could help us\nWe are looking for Games Helpers\nwe are looking for people with seedbox\n\n\nIf you think you are one of those contact us at\n\nHow To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent)\n\nTorrent Client - Preferences - Bandwidth - Number of connections - Set aprox. 500 for each\nTorrent Client - Preferences - BiTorrent - Protocol Encryption - Forced\nBandwidth Allocation - High (Set download/upload limit - Unlimited)\nStop Other Active Torrents - Start downloading and wait for connections.\nEnjoy and Seed for at least 1:1 ratio.
