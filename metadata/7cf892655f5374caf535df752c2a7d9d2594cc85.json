But these files have only 12kHz range, so I rerecorded it \ndirectly using CMSS2 to GoldWave. Then I remaster it, made some cue sheets and split this\n125 minutes big file to 85 files. (Last 3 are lately added from Monkey Island 2 soundtrack)\n\nSome &quot;same size&quot; songs are faded to previous (like Barbers, Blood Island) usually in half of &quot;main&quot; song. For example - in extracted songs there are 5 versions of Barber indoor. So I faded 2 song together and 3 songs together and put it to correct order. So there are 3 versions of Blood Island song (v1, lighthouse, separated).\n\nAll files converted to FLAC using 16bit Maximum pattern.\nBut if you want my master record in 24bit WAV, write me e-mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;235452405163545240510d404c4e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nCD1 contains base master cut, but there is a length limitation on CD, so not all songs is here\nCD2 represents bonus CD, where most of missing songs are available\n\nFile names and titles in FLAC I made separately for each file (This was really hard work :-)\n\nBUT STILL, THERE AREN'T ALL SONGS - so if you miss your favourite, write me e-mail and I will rerecord it for you.\n\nPS: Seed please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf892655f5374caf535df752c2a7d9d2594cc85","amp;dn":"The+Curse+of+Monkey+Island+-+Game+soundtrack+%28recorded+by+wqcr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf892655f5374caf535df752c2a7d9d2594cc85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,248,146,101,95,83,116,202,245,53,223,117,44,42,125,157,37,148,204,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
