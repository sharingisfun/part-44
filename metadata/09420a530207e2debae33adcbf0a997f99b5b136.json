There is quite a bit of digi static during Wonderin', there was also a DO in Radio Child, and one in Mercy.. Some Board Static during JKMB, 2 pieces of digi at about 2:30 in Parsons and static at the start of D3.. Mr. Soul also cuts a bit early....OVERALL, sounds real nice though.. \n\nAlan Schwartz cleaned this as best as could (or anyone else for that matter)... Thanks to Steve Bohannon for the show.\n\n\n\n*** Set 1 *** \n01 Pickin' Up The Pieces *  =\n02 Blight *  =\n03 Junior *  = \n04 Wondering \n05 Gradle\n06 Radio Child \n07 Happy Child &gt; \n08 Disco\n09 Walkin' (For Your Love) \n10 Mercy * &gt; \n11 Flat Foot Flewzy * \n \n\n*** Set 2 ***\n01 She Caught The Katy &gt; \n02 Better Off, \n03 It Ain't No Use &gt; \n04 Tie Your Shoes &gt; \n05 Space Wrangler &gt; \n06 Just Kissed My Baby, \n07 Henry Parsons Died, \n08 C.

Either that or their original DSBD recordings off the board had too much digi static that was unlistenable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09420a530207e2debae33adcbf0a997f99b5b136","amp;dn":"Widespread+Panic+-+1996-02-10+-+Sheraton+Ballroom+in+Steamboat+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09420a530207e2debae33adcbf0a997f99b5b136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,66,10,83,2,7,226,222,186,227,58,220,191,10,153,127,153,181,177,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
