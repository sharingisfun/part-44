Following appearances on a series of compilations, Mogwai returned later in the year with the 7&quot; &quot;Summer&quot;; after another early-1997 single, &quot;New Paths to Helicon,&quot; they issued Ten Rapid, a collection of their earliest material.\n\nAfter Government Commissions: BBC Sessions 1996-2004 arrived Mr. Beast, which was released in 2006, found the band going in a softer, more reflective direction. Late that year, the band's collaboration with Clint Mansell on the soundtrack to The Fountain arrived; Mogwai also crafted the score for Douglas Gordon's Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which was released in the U.K. in 2006 and in the U.S. the following spring. The Batcat EP, which featured a collaboration with garage-psych legend Roky Erickson, arrived in late summer 2008, heralding the release of The Hawk Is Howling -- which reunited the band with producer Andy Miller for the first time in a decade -- that fall. In 2010, Mogwai released their first live album, Special Moves, as a package with the Vincent Moon-directed concert film Burning. For 2011's Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will, the band reunited with Young Team producer Paul Savage for a more streamlined set of songs. Later that year, Mogwai followed up with an EP of unreleased material from the Hardcore sessions, Earth Division, released on Sub Pop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99fbe4df5cdd12b0eb0231a921a4b55ac6878d2d","amp;dn":"Mogwai+-+A+Wrenched+Virile+Lore+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99fbe4df5cdd12b0eb0231a921a4b55ac6878d2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,251,228,223,92,221,18,176,235,2,49,169,33,164,181,90,198,135,141,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
