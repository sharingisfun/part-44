Here we have 16 folders of drumkits, along with presets for Kontakt, Logic EXS, Halion, and Reason.\nUnfortunately, the kits don&amp;#039;t always follow the standard GM mapping, although the main kick drum of each on is on middle C. Feel free to re-map the kits in your sampler of choice, or use the samples as oneshots.\n\nTorrent contains 16 RAR files with 246 samples\n----------------------------------------------\nAlesis hr 16, Dance Kit, Dance Kit 2, DnB Kit, Electro Kit, Funk Kit, FX kit, Hip Hop Kit, House Kit, Indian Percussion, Korg DDM 110, Live Kit, Percussion, RnB Kit, Roland TR-808 (25 kicks and 25 snares), Roland TR-909.\n\nAll files are normalized and acidized oneshot 16-bit WAVs at 44.1KHz. \n\n--\nArty - &quot;Kick it!&quot;\n23rd February 2008.\n\nP.S.
