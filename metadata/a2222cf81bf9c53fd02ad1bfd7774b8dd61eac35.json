TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve stumbled from one crisis to the next: The rebellion of their human slaves. The relentless questing of the species of Known Space. The spectacular rise of the starfish-like GwÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oth. The onslaught of the genocidal Pak. \n\nCatastrophe looms again as past crises return---and converge. Who can possibly save the Fleet of Worlds from its greatest peril yet?\n\nLouis Wu? Trapped in the Wunderland civil war, all he wants is to go home---but the only possible escape will plunge him into unknowable danger. \n\nOlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ro? The GwÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oth ensemble mind fled across the stars to establish a colony world free from tyranny. But some problems cannot be left behind, and other problems---like the Fleet of Worlds itself---are racing straight at them. \n\nAchilles? Despite past disgrace, the charismatic Puppeteer politician knows he is destined for greatness. He will do anything to seize power---and to take his revenge on everyone who ever stood in his way. \n\n                                \n                             Format 1 - ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2222cf81bf9c53fd02ad1bfd7774b8dd61eac35","amp;dn":"Betrayer+of+Worlds+by+Larry+Niven+%28Fleet+of+Worlds+Book+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2222cf81bf9c53fd02ad1bfd7774b8dd61eac35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,34,44,248,27,249,197,63,208,42,209,191,215,119,75,141,214,30,172,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
