The performances span the classic &quot;hits&quot; of the 1966-1970 era.\n\nThe interviews, interspersed between the songs, show the band members (Grace Slick, Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Cassidy, Spencer Dryden) fondly, insightfully, and humorously recalling what made Jefferson Airplane tick.\n\nSet list:\n01. ItÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s no Secret\n02. Somebody To Love\n03. High Flyin' Bird\n04. White Rabbit\n05. Martha\n06. Crown Of Creation\n07. Lather\n08. House At Pooneil Corness\n09.
