The band achieved notable success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, with &quot;Block Buster&quot; (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number two hits in &quot;Hell Raiser&quot; (1973), &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot; (1973) and &quot;Teenage Rampage&quot; (1974). Their first self-written and produced single &quot;Fox on the Run&quot; (1975) also reached number two on the UK charts.\nSweet membership has undergone a number of changes, and during different periods Scott, Connolly and Priest also each formed their own &quot;Sweet&quot;, resulting in the separate bands Steve Priest's Sweet, Andy Scott's Sweet and Brian Connolly's New Sweet.\nConnolly died in 1997, and Tucker in 2002.\nTwo of the bands are still in existence: the U.S. version of The Sweet, founded by original bass player Steve Priest, and the U.K. version of The Sweet, featuring Andy Scott.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.
