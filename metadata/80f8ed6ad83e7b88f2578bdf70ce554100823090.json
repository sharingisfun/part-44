Always rare stuff, always great stuff...\n\nFile : 742 MB, duration: 1:35:03, type: AVI, 1 audio stream(s), quality: 42% \nVideo: 677 MB, 996 Kbps, 23.976 fps, 592*336 (16:9), XVID\nAudio: 65 MB, 96 Kbps, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, MP3, VBR\n\nJonathan Pryce (from 007's &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; &amp; DeNiro's &quot;Ronin&quot; is the demonic proprietor of Dark's Pandemonium Carnival, preys upon the vanities, the delusions, and the regrets of the townspeople by granting their wishes at the expense of their souls. Jason Robards, as the meek librarian Charles Halloway, becomes his unlikely nemesis when his son Will, with his best friend Jim Nightshade (a deliciously dark name in its own right), discovers the secret of Dark's nightmarish carnival. \n\nWhen they become hunted by Dark's minions (including Pam Grier [from &quot;Foxy Brown&quot; &amp; who played Philip Michael Thomas' old flame/girlfriend on Miami Vice]) as the beautiful and mysterious Dust Witch), Halloway must confront his own fears and regrets to save the boys. Clayton captures the idyll of childhood in the fall with rich autumnal colors, his camera gliding along with the energetic boys as they tear through field and forests. The climax, however, gets lost in a cacophony of competing special effects, imaginatively visualized but never very terrifying, as if the movie producers resisted the uneasy undercurrent of the story. It's more dark fantasy than horror, a nightmarish adventure filtered through the memory of a man remembering his childhood in mythic terms.\n=======================================================================================\nThe best video/audio players to play this movie are: \n\nFree DivX Player Windows: http://www.divx.com/divx/windows/ \nMac: http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279 \n\nVLC (VideoLan)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThe KM Player  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&lt;/a&gt; \n======================================================================================== \nPlease be patient &amp; continue to share after your download completes. \nThe more who share, the faster everyone can get the file. \n\nTo all who post comments below: Thank you &amp; we appreciate your feedback. \n\nEnjoy!
