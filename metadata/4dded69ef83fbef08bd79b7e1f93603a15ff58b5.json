Once there, they discover that King Kong is a real creature, living in a massive jungle where creatures from prehistoric times have been protected and hidden for millions of years. As the explorers search for the great ape, their quest puts them up against both Kong and his dinosaur enemies. Ultimately, it is the attention of a beautiful human woman that soothes Kong long enough for him to be subdued by the explorers and shipped back to New York, where his bleak future involves being put on display in front of humans... but how long can even the mightiest shackles of man hold back an ape 25 feet tall?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dded69ef83fbef08bd79b7e1f93603a15ff58b5","amp;dn":"King+Kong+%282005%29+Deluxe+Extended+Edition+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dded69ef83fbef08bd79b7e1f93603a15ff58b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,222,214,158,248,63,190,240,139,215,155,126,31,147,96,58,21,255,88,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
