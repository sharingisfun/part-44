Who's That Noisy\n\nAnswer to last week: Tom Cruise\n\n\n\nSegment #4. Your Questions and E-mails\n\nQuestion #1: 432 Hz \nI'm a software engineer who writes music as a hobby. Recently I have bumped into the topic of 432 Hz tuning in music. You can find a lot of &quot;information&quot; about this all over the internet. The basic premise here that once upon a time, musical instruments were all tuned so that the note A4's frequency was 432 Hz, which is &quot;said to be mathematically consistent with the patterns of the universe&quot;. Then Nazi Germany came along and deliberately changed the standard to 440 Hz which is the most common tuning today, &quot;after conducting scientific researches to determine which range of frequencies best induce fear and aggression&quot;.\nI was pretty saddened to find out that there are musicians who actually believe all of this.\nThe &quot;advocates&quot; of this even go as far as claiming that listening to music tuned to 432 Hz can cure cancer and other medical conditions.\nI believe that this topic might be an interesting one for you guys to discuss in the podcast. Please feel free to contact me if you need more information on this subject.\nBest Regards,\nNissim\n\n\n\nSegment #5. Science or Fiction\nEach week our host will come up with three science news items or facts, two genuine, one fictitious. He will challenge our panel of skeptics to sniff out the fake Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and you can play along.\n\nTheme: Biology Textbooks\n\n#1) Frankenstein pieced together the parts of dead bodies. Finally he brought a creature to life. But Frankenstein's creation was an eight-foot monster. Eventually the monster destroyed the biologist.\n\n#2) The regular consumption of meat in the diets of adolescents and young adults can result in an early onset of necrosis, a form of cell injury caused by toxins and infections.\n\n#3) Several centuries ago, some 'very light skinned' people were shipwrecked on a tropical island. After 'many years under the tropical sun', this light skinned population became 'dark-skinned'.\n \n\nSegment #7.
