One day, Mashiro Shiina - a cute girl who happens to be also a cosmopolitan, brilliant artist - moves into Sakurasou. \n\nSorata thinks to himself that he should protect Mashiro from the weirdos at Sakurasou, but Mashiro has a surprising secret: she has no idea how to take care of herself. She gets lost if she goes out, and her room is a complete mess. Sorata's dorm mates designate him as the &quot;master&quot; of Mashiro, and thus, an ordinary boy and a brilliant girl must live like &quot;a master and his pet.&quot; \n\n\n\nGenres: comedy, drama, romance\n\n\nThemes: school\n\n\nRelease date : October 25, 2012\n\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\n\nSubTitle language : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0992210c3394a7cf31157f7f63e6b08cc887549c","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sakurasou+no+Pet+na+Kanojo+-+03+%5B480p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0992210c3394a7cf31157f7f63e6b08cc887549c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,146,33,12,51,148,167,207,49,21,127,127,99,230,176,140,200,135,84,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
