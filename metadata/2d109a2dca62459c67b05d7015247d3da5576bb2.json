The group's emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. U.K. audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band their first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album's success with higher record sales and an increased public profile.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Square One\n02.White Shadows\n03.Low\n04.X&amp;Y\n05.Clocks\n06.In My Place\n07.God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\n08.Trouble\n09.Don't Panic\n10.Brothers &amp; Sisters\n11.Sparks\n12.Spies\n13.Parachutes\n14.Only Superstition\n15.See You Soon\n16.Help Is Round The Corner\n17.I Ran Away\n18.No More Keeping My Feet On The Ground\n19.Everything's Not Lost\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Speed Of Sound\n02.Talk\n03.A Message\n04.What If\n05.The Scientist\n06.Politik\n07.A Rush Of Blood To The Head\n08.Shiver\n09.High Speed\n10.Yellow\n11.Bigger Stronger\n12.We Never Change\n13.Careful Where You Stand\n14.For You\n15.Easy To Please\n16.In Bloom Blaum\n17.Such A Rush\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                    ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d109a2dca62459c67b05d7015247d3da5576bb2","amp;dn":"Coldplay+-+Greatest+Hits+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d109a2dca62459c67b05d7015247d3da5576bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,16,154,45,202,98,69,156,103,176,93,112,21,36,125,61,165,87,107,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
