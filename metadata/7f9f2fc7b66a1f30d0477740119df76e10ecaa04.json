The book opens by presenting important background information on polymer chemistry and physicochemical characterization of polymers. This serves as essential scientific support for the subsequent chapters, each of which is devoted to the applications of polymers in a particular medical specialty. The coverage is broad, encompassing orthopedics, ophthalmology, tissue engineering, surgery, dentistry, oncology, drug delivery, nephrology, wound dressing and healing, and cardiology. The development of polymers that enhance the biocompatibility of blood-contacting medical devices and the incorporation of polymers within biosensors are also addressed. This book is an excellent guide to the recent advances in polymeric biomaterials and bridges the gap between the research literature and standard textbooks on the applications of polymers in medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9f2fc7b66a1f30d0477740119df76e10ecaa04","amp;dn":"Advanced+Polymers+in+Medicine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9f2fc7b66a1f30d0477740119df76e10ecaa04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,159,47,199,182,106,31,48,208,71,119,64,17,157,247,110,16,236,170,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
