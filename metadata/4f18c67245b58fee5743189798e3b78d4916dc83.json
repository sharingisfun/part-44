Perhaps the most surreal moment of a surreal outing was Letter From a Fan/So Heavy, So High, a guitar-squall-laden duet with Nataly Dawn playing the role of the pen-wielding obsessive.\nAs an entry to the mainstream from one hitherto best known for being half of ever-droll indie darlings Pomplamoose, it was quite some curveball. And Dawn more than held her own against Manilow.\nCareer suitably kick-started, she sought funds for her first proper solo album from the Kickstarter website. In what became a modern-day fairy tale, she asked for $20,000, but received over $100,000 and was in a position to hand the finished product to her new label.\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent her money carefully. How I Knew Her veers between sparse and angular to lavish, hence the lovely string section, used to best effect on the outstanding Why Did You Marry. Elsewhere, the title trackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apocalyptic ending echoes The BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ A Day in the Life. Overall itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sound of a woman brimming with ideas as she seizes her moment.\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a graduate of the mildly quirky school. Indeed, Araceli bounces like an especially jumpy Tigger, but mercifully sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not beholden to quirk and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shark-eyed steel to her lyrics. She nods to Mary Margaret OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢HaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way with oscillation, Kate HavnevikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack for painting an enigmatic picture and Regina SpektorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yen for a winning melody. \nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkness to the title track, which details her grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I bet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like some answersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), while Please DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ScreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jaunty disposition hides its startlingly vicious tone. Even Steven is how The Stray Cats might have sounded with a knowing Californian woman at their helm.\nCultdom seems assured at the very least, and How I Knew Her is less an album to yield all its myriad charms instantly, more one to slow-drip its way to adoration. Dawn has the intelligence to sway the cognoscenti, the wide-eyed charm to seduce the masses, and an other-worldliness that ensures that, for all those she embraces, nobody sounds quite like her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f18c67245b58fee5743189798e3b78d4916dc83","amp;dn":"Nataly+Dawn+-+How+I+Knew+Her+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f18c67245b58fee5743189798e3b78d4916dc83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,24,198,114,69,181,143,238,87,67,24,151,152,227,183,141,73,22,220,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
