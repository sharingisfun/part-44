For 30 years He thoroughly dominated the music charts all over Africa. \n\nHe was dubbed &quot;The sorcerer of the guitar&quot; for his exceptional guitar stringing skills. But it was his ability as a bandleader and organizer that put him a cut above the rest. He also earned several other nicknames and titles such as &quot;Le Grande Maitre&quot; .For over 30 years his band maintained its position as the most influential band on the continent despite several departures and defections of certain influential members. Now more than a decade after his death , his music is still extremely popular among Congolese and Africans in general. , \n\nThere is not a single African musician who can claim popularity anywhere close to what Franco had.
