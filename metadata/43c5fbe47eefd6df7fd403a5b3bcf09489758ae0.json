Bodybuilders Magazine - Fall 2011 (US)\nEnglish | PDF | 206 pages | 85.3 Mb\n\nReps! magazine was started by Robert Kennedy with the premier issue released in January of 2006. Based on his reputation alone one had to assume that the same man that brought us MuscleMag thirty years ago would release another quality publication.\n\nReps! is a different kind of magazine. Instead of focusing on professional bodybuilders this magazine is for those of us who are not yet or may never be into competing. Although it teaches us about building muscle and losing fat there is a heavy emphasis on keeping a healthy balance and staying proportioned. This magazine is about looking good and feeling good rather than stepping on stage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c5fbe47eefd6df7fd403a5b3bcf09489758ae0","amp;dn":"Reps%21+-+Bodybuilders+Magazine+-+Fall+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c5fbe47eefd6df7fd403a5b3bcf09489758ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,197,251,228,126,239,214,223,127,212,3,165,179,188,240,148,137,117,138,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
