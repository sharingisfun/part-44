Similar to the voyeuristic thrill of watching little suburbanites toil away in The Sims, the idea of playing the part of a high school senior juggling his or her social and scholastic obligations is intriguing. This promise is squandered in Brooktown High, which suffers from really awkward pacing, is sorely lacking in content, and leans on the most unimaginative high school stereotypes this side of an early '80s teen comedy.\n\nRequirements/instructions =):\n     *Hacked/Modded PSP\n     *Custom Firmware\n     *ISO Folder in Root of PSP\n     *Put file in there\n     *play the game through the PSP game section\n     *Have fun!\n\n     *For a guide on how to do the above, please see a video I made at scroll down and go to the video entitled PSP PANDORA BATTERY GUIDE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:240a3d36fc2bad89121115c76439b15ceab3ee4c","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+Brooktown+High%3A+Senior+Year+%7Bby+GamerFroob%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"240a3d36fc2bad89121115c76439b15ceab3ee4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,10,61,54,252,43,173,137,18,17,21,199,100,57,177,92,234,179,238,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
