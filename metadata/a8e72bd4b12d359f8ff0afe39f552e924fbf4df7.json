Encouraged by good reviews the band additionally did their first headliner tour in the U.S. with Mexican Infinitum Obscure. Since the tour Sorcery has been working on the follow-up album and earlier this year they made a groovy gig with GÃ¤vle Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nThere were three demos in the late 80's that Sorcery helped define what would later become known worldwide as the Swedish death metal. The attention led to an EP and a debut album &quot;Bloodchilling Tales&quot;, released in 1991.\r\n\r\nYear: 2016\r\nCountry: Sweden\r\nGenre: Death Metal\r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: 192Kbps\r\nSize: 70.9 MB\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n1.Holy Ground\t05:17\r\n2.The New Armageddon\t05:13\r\n3.Insanity Arise\t03:59\r\n4.Dark Waves\t05:29\r\n5.Hellstorm\t05:16\r\n6.Cleansed by Fire\t06:21\r\n7.Mass Murder\t03:47\r\n8.The Creator\t04:50\r\n9.Black Wings\t03:30\r\n10.Garden of Bones\t07:27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e72bd4b12d359f8ff0afe39f552e924fbf4df7","amp;dn":"Sorcery+-+Garden+Of+Bones+%5BMetal%5D+%282016%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e72bd4b12d359f8ff0afe39f552e924fbf4df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,231,43,212,177,45,53,159,143,240,175,227,159,85,46,146,79,191,77,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
