It?s about a lesbian private investigator, played by Susie Porter.\n\nIn the 80?s, actress Kelly McGillis became a kind of pin-up girl with boys when she played against Tom Cruise in the visually effective but ridiculously testosterone-bursting box-office hit Top Gun. Some twenty years later, now a mature woman, she does a more interesting role as a poetry teacher who becomes the lover of a poetry student (Porter, incidentally).\n\nAs a thriller, this film is average in quality considering the plot, but with a little unusual script by Anne Kennedy; and I know that some girls really get the hots for Susie Porter.\n\nFull, uncompressed dvd quality.\nPAL 2.35:1\nSpoken language: English\nOptional subtitles: English\nAudio: Dolby Digital stereo\nRunning time: 90 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b49cb32bf97c8c8dba2127de42537386fa892566","amp;dn":"The+Monkey%5C%27s+Mask+%28Lesbian+thriller%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b49cb32bf97c8c8dba2127de42537386fa892566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,156,179,43,249,124,140,141,186,33,39,222,66,83,115,134,250,137,37,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
