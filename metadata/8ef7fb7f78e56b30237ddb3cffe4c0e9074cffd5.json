As youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear, over the past year, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continued to perfect his art on both the production and lyrical fronts. Over the past few years, Sleaze has done a good job of developing a unique rhyme style and sound. If the mainstream hip-hop world was about QUALITY as opposed toÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ shootÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœaboutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ todayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ never-the-lessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if it were about quality, Sleaze could find himself a place in the mainstream. However, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the case, with the exception of a few, REAL hip-hopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place is now under the underground. There are too many only interested in replicating formulas, this has been the case for nearly 20 years. Mainstream hip-hop is now represented by biters biting biters biting biters. No room for unique voices such as Sleaze and the host of talented EMCEES holding it down for Richmond, Virginia aka RVA on this release. Consider yourself one of the lucky ones, to be clued into great music that many others are too oblivious to care about. Thank you for checking out REAL hip-hop.\n\nRememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ everything we release is cool to share! Always keep the music movingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ blog itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ podcast it! If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in radioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ support independent music and broadcast it!\n\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection: Netlabels\n\nArtist/Composer: The Honorable Sleaze\nDate: 2012-07-17\nKeywords: blocsonic; maxbloc; richmond; virginia; the honorable sleaze; flac; mp3; ogg\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-BSOG0018.pdf.zip \tZIP \t11.4 MB\n00-BSOG0018_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t109.0 MB\n00-BSOG0018_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t146.5 MB\n00-BSOG0018_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t240.2 MB\n00-BSOG0018_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t9.8 MB\n00-BSOG0018_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t28.5 MB\n00-BSOG0018_FLAC-24Bit.zip \tZIP \t507.6 MB\n00-BSOG0018_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t295.9 MB\n00-BSOG0018_OGG.zip \tZIP \t109.1 MB\nAudio Files \tVBR MP3 \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3\nBroad Street Boogie \t3.2 MB\n\t1.6 MB\n\t6.5 MB\nLove Me/Hate Me (Featuring Joey Ripps) \t2.7 MB\n\t1.3 MB\n\t5.9 MB\nDreamflower (Keep The Dream Alive) (Featuring BCMusic 1st) \t4.9 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n\t8.6 MB\nHigher \t5.3 MB\n\t2.9 MB\n\t8.6 MB\nBoston (Featuring Octavion Xcellence) \t2.4 MB\n\t1.2 MB\n\t5.8 MB\nThank Y'all (Featuring Rah Scrilla, BCMusic 1st, &amp; Cee Jay) \t4.8 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n\t8.3 MB\nHeat (Featuring RT) \t3.6 MB\n\t1.8 MB\n\t7.5 MB\nYou &amp; Me (Featuring Ryan Flow) \t5.5 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n\t9.2 MB\nChurch Hill Rap (Featuring William Robi) \t2.4 MB\n\t1.4 MB\n\t5.9 MB\nJunk Mail (Featuring BCMusic 1st) \t2.9 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t6.7 MB\nDown (Featuring Rah Scrilla) \t3.8 MB\n\t2.2 MB\n\t8.5 MB\nBlood In My Pen, Ink In My Veins (Featuring Emphasys) \t4.6 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n\t9.3 MB\nFist City \t3.3 MB\n\t1.7 MB\n\t6.6 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0018.jpg \t443.6 KB\n\t5.9 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0018_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0018_meta.xml \tMetadata \t2.1 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef7fb7f78e56b30237ddb3cffe4c0e9074cffd5","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0018%5D+The+Honorable+Sleaze+-+Broad+Street+Boogie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef7fb7f78e56b30237ddb3cffe4c0e9074cffd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,247,251,127,120,229,107,48,35,125,219,60,255,228,192,233,7,76,255,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
