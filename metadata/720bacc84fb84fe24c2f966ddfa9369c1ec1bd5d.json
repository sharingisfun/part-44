Her childhood dream has always been to be a singer, however, and she recently drew eyebrows (and made Tilda Swinton cry) when singing a song in Quechua during her acceptance of a Golden Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nWarmi, her first album, is mostly in Quechua, so even the most prolific writer about Peru can tell you exactly the meaning of the lyrics since he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t speak more than a few words of Quechua. Rather I can describe the experience and feeling that the music presents. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exotic, strange, eerie, sensitive, and wonderful at the same time. The charango, quenas, and violins are common throughout the album. The songs are similar to sad huaynos played throughout the Andes, though SolierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice gives almost a poppy element to them (I usually hear them from middle aged women and old men).\n\nThe album name is Warmi, which means ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Quechua, because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about women who have stood up for themselves and to adversity,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Solier has been quoted as saying. Solier is from Ayacucho, where the Shining Path led a war of terror and death that plagued Peru for decades and to some small extent is still going on. Whether she mentions this specifically or not, this is part of her music.\n\nPorque me miras asi, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy do you look at me like this?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the few Spanish songs on the album and one of the best. Ripu Ripusajmi is a protest song that tells the story of a girl escaping from the physical abuse of her father. The songs ring of Susana Baca and Afro-Peruvian music, rather than of popular Peruvian culture that has generally prefers Aerosmith and Metallica (and other washed up 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bands that are now playing in Lima). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s far from popular music that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear on the radio and I admit I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t listen to the album much ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but the songs have staying power.\n\nWarmi\nMagaly Solier\n*The album is unavailable outside of Peru\n\nSource: nicholasgill @ http://newworldreview.com/?p=1319","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720bacc84fb84fe24c2f966ddfa9369c1ec1bd5d","amp;dn":"Magaly+Solier+-+Warmi+%282009%29+%28MP3+192+CBR%29+%28sic+from+Peru%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720bacc84fb84fe24c2f966ddfa9369c1ec1bd5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,11,172,200,79,184,79,226,76,47,150,109,223,169,54,156,30,193,189,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
