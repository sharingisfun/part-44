This gives an increase in compression by more than 10%. (Saved me 4GB on my entire nds-rom collection.) If your devkit doesn&amp;#039;t support 7z natively use either WinRAR (http://www.rarsoft.com/) or 7z (http://www.7-zip.org/) to unpack. (Thanks to poke from bitslicker for inducing this change.)\n\nI will keep using the release list from Pocket Heaven despite some others beeing updated more often. PH&amp;#039;s list seldom include nukes and whatnot so it remains nice and clean.\n\nCheck out the other older, and future, packs at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/magumagu/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4927e494f162beff6ea3586adc9820c04c53bd8","amp;dn":"NDS+verified+rompack+1001-1100+by+joda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4927e494f162beff6ea3586adc9820c04c53bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,146,126,73,79,22,43,239,246,234,53,134,173,201,130,12,4,197,59,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
