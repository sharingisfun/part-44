So I needed to start over. The tape itself is ok, but I guess it was a bit loose in certain places. So I ended up capturing in parts. You won't notice the transitions, except for the opening of Somebody, other than that it's as good as I could hope for. The audio at the end of Blasphemous Rumours is abit out of sync but it's only for about 10-15 seconds. Certain songs I had to channel through another vhs player as I just kept dropping frames, this includes about 4 songs, but the quality is about as good(or bad) as the rest of the video. Hopefully this will be released on dvd or even blu-ray in the future, but this is the best I can conjure atm. If I'd own the japaneese Laser Disc the result would have been better, but cba to buy an old LD player and an overpriced copy of the video from ebay.\n\nI ripped the audio of this in m4a [aac], so it's playable on the ipod. For those who can't play this back on their mp3 player I guess foobar2000 let's you convert it to mp3 or another playable format.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c6987343fe4a11d8489e433be99d25f75e173de","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Live+In+Hamburg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c6987343fe4a11d8489e433be99d25f75e173de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,105,135,52,63,228,161,29,132,137,228,51,190,153,210,95,117,225,115,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
