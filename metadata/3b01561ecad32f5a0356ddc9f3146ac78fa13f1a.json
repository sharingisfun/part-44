The Rockpalast Night where this show was taken from started on April 3 around 11:00 pm with Rick James. Van played the second set and this was around 1:00 am on April 4. Therefore date of the actual show started on April 3 (in the late evening) and ended on April 4 (in the early morning). The broadcast date was the following evening April 4. Most of the Rockpalast shows are broadcast the date following the actual show. Hence the show was played over the 3rd and 4th of April 1982. It was broadcast live across Europe on April 4, 1982 that evening. This is why this show sometimes circulates as April 3 , 1982","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b01561ecad32f5a0356ddc9f3146ac78fa13f1a","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Rockpalast+live+1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b01561ecad32f5a0356ddc9f3146ac78fa13f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,1,86,30,202,211,47,90,3,86,221,201,243,20,106,199,143,161,63,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
