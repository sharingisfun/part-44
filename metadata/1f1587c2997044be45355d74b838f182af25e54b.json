Falling Stars and Broken Hearts may lack some of the comedic charms of his previous albums, but it should still serve the legion of Fredheads just fine. There are plenty of gems here: the creepy Tom Waits-inspired &quot;Pretty Girl,&quot; the infectious guitar pop of &quot;Sugarcane,&quot; and the sweet samba of &quot;Soft on My Shoulder.&quot; Unfortunately, compared to Eaglesmith's anthemic Lipstick, Lies &amp; Gasoline, the slower-paced, more earnest Falling Stars is a bit of a downer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1587c2997044be45355d74b838f182af25e54b","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith+-+Falling+Stars+and+Broken+Hearts+%5B2002%5D%5BEAC%2Clog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1587c2997044be45355d74b838f182af25e54b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,21,135,194,153,112,68,190,69,53,93,116,184,56,241,130,175,37,229,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
