The question is does this music stand up on its own, apart from the exhibit. The answer is a resounding yes! Sylvian produces original and interesting ambient music. The selections are long (&quot;Approaching Silence&quot; is over 38 minutes long) yet never get boring. It is to Sylvian's credit that he can keep the listener interested for that long with this genre of music. Sylvian uses instruments and sounds to create his own creative ambient music. The short-wave samples, for example, add an eeriness in &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice,&quot; which adds to the overall sound of the piece. This music is not for every taste, but fans of Sylvian and ambient music will find this to be a treat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37de7cf49ffc97978bc3bc236eb7fc1e0f43d1f2","amp;dn":"Davis+Sylvian+-+Approaching+Silence+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37de7cf49ffc97978bc3bc236eb7fc1e0f43d1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,222,124,244,159,252,151,151,139,195,188,35,110,183,252,30,15,67,209,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
