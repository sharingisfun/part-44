But those records don't tell the whole story. In the same period, Sylvian created a more playful body of work: a series of collaborations and side projects with leading talents of pop and improv, electronic and contemporary classical music. The best of these recordings are gathered here on Sleepwalkers, meticulously sequenced and remixed: the fruits of one-off meetings and lifelong partnerships, they jump from bliss to intrigue, romance to sensuality, as arch experiments lead into the lushest pop.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f24fc2def29df88b369fbe80561862b75e3e7b0a","amp;dn":"David+Sylvian+-+Sleepwalkers+%5Bmp3-vbr-2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f24fc2def29df88b369fbe80561862b75e3e7b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,79,194,222,242,157,248,139,54,159,190,128,86,24,98,183,94,62,123,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
