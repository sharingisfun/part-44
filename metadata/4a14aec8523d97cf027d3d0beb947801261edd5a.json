First, it violently took the life of a young girl, leaving her mangled remains rotting on the beach, her echoed screams cursing the night skies. Next, it moved its attention to the children, ripping and tearing as blood turned the calm waters red. Then, just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water, it struck again, mercilessly rampaging in the estuary and attacking the piers where the fisherman unknowingly sat waiting for a catch. Now, something must be done, before it returns to feed. With the Amity tourist board and town Mayor Larry Vaugn determined to keep the beaches open for the Summer Season, its up to Police Chief Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and colorful fisherman Quint to hunt down the 200 Pound White Death and put an end to the bloodshed. They are going to need a bigger boat.\n\nIMDb RATING: 8.3/10 (131,489 votes) Top 250: #106\n\nOriginal Source  Jaws DVDRip\nRelease Length  124 min\n\nContainer:  Audio Video Interleave (.AVI)\nVideo Codec Type: XviD\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nBitrate: 1 574 Kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass\nResolution: 720x304\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.213\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nSize: 992 MiB (71%)\n\nAudio Codec:  AC-3\nBitrate: 448 Kbps\nBitrate Type: Constant\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannels: 6 channels\nSize: 398 MiB (28%)\n\ncredit -IZON- BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a14aec8523d97cf027d3d0beb947801261edd5a","amp;dn":"Jaws+Collectors+Edition+DVDRip+XviD-IZON%28Kingdom+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a14aec8523d97cf027d3d0beb947801261edd5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,20,174,200,82,61,151,207,2,125,61,11,235,148,120,1,38,30,221,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
