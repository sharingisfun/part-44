Land of the Living \n\n\nAfter experimenting with synthesizers and a pop sound on his solo debut, Don Henley hits the mark on his sophomore release,\nBuilding the Perfect Beast. This album established Henley as an artist in his own right after many successful years with the Eagles,\nas it spawned numerous hits. While the songs seem crafted for pop radio, it's hard to fault him for choosing arrangements that\nwould get his messages to the masses. Unlike most pop in the 1980s, however, Henley had deep intellectual themes layered\nbeneath the synthesizer sounds and crisp production. In the opening song &quot;Boys of Summer,&quot; he talks about trying to recapture\nthe past while knowing that things will never be the same. Henley has a gift for writing about the heart and soul of America and for\nmixing his love for the country and small-town life (&quot;Sunset Grill&quot;) with cynicism about government (&quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot;)\nand modernization (&quot;Month of Sundays&quot;). Although the politics and the sound of the album make the decade of release easy to\nplace, Henley's earnest delivery and universal messages give many of the tracks a timeless feel, which is no small feat.\nThis is Henley's most consistent album, and it is the place to start for those wanting to sample his solo work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed88641d159164e9220b43a814542103a3f5b337","amp;dn":"Don+Henley+-+Building+The+Perfect+Beast++MFSL+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed88641d159164e9220b43a814542103a3f5b337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,136,100,29,21,145,100,233,34,11,67,168,20,84,33,3,163,245,179,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
