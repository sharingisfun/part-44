E.g. the game crashes if you play\r\nthe campaign with Jorgen (black guy to the left) or if you load\r\ncertain maps in skirmish mode. We confirmed this happens on\r\nthe original game on uplay too, so this is not crack related\r\nThe x64 version has been much more stable - so we recommend you\r\nplay that if you can until Ubisoft fixes their bugs\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes:\r\n\r\nBlock the game's exe in your firewall to prevent the game from\r\ntrying to go online\r\nIf you install games to your systemdrive, it may be necessary\r\nto run this game with admin privileges instead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7856ee0622fd9406ff1dd68a62cc22323f383cbb","amp;dn":"Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VII-CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7856ee0622fd9406ff1dd68a62cc22323f383cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,86,238,6,34,253,148,6,255,29,214,138,98,204,34,50,63,56,60,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
