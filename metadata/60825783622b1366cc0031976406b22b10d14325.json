Having found out that the murderer of his son is to be granted Amnesty after the civil war, a grandfather sends his grandson on a quest: Kill the murderer. Do not return until you do. Thus, Atim embarks on a journey to N'Djamena, the capitol, to seek out his target, the baker Nassara. But Nassara is a haunted man, who has lost his larynx, and whose bakery is in danger of bankruptcy. When he takes Atim in as an apprentice, Atim soon finds that taking the life of another man is not a simple matter. Told as a series of beautifully composed tableaus, Daratt has its own voice and vocabulary with which it tells an eternal story of revenge and redemption.\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the film has the feel of a gift.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Manohla Dargis, New York Times\n\n;;\n\nBoth broadcasts followed by an interview with director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun.\n\n\n\nPurchase the Daratt DVD\n\n\n\nAbout CINEMONDO:\n\nLink TV's CINEMONDO is a nationally broadcast, ground breaking world cinema series hosted and co-curated by Peter Scarlet, Artistic Director of the Tribeca Film Festival.
