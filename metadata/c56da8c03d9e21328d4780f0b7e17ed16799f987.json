The problem is that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still playing it safe. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been dubbed Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe New BoringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (oh hey, Emeli SandÃƒÂ© and Ed Sheeran) still dominates the radio, possibly because the bands creating innovative and interesting music are hidden away under a massive lack of personality. Would you be able to pick out any of Django Django from a line-up? Course not. Is anyone ever going to write a retrospective on the rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll excesses of Alex Trimble from Two Door? Doubtful.\n\nThis is where Ty Segall comes in. You may have heard his name popping up more frequently of late, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Ã¢â‚¬ËœTwinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the San FranciscanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixth solo album, and the third record heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s put out in 2012, following one with his band (Ã¢â‚¬ËœSlaughterhouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) and one alongside White Fence (Ã¢â‚¬ËœHairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢). On record, he sounds like Black Lips having a ruck with Tame Impala. Live, he rolls around in the crowd and plays such heavy and joyous riffs that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but dance so hard itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to stamp the earth away. Segall, often compared to the late, great Memphis punk rocker Jay Reatard, seems born to be a cult star. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll squirrel away, prolifically churning out one weird and wonderful album after another, all in the shadows, only to end up being namechecked by the 2030 version of The Horrors and given some all-too-late recognition. We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let this happen.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœTwinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an incredible album and one that makes complete sense in the context of now. It has the reckless spirit of a record that hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been over-analysed, but with an intense flurry of ideas from someone in the absolute prime of their creativity. It veers from psych-tinged, Syd Barrett wonks (on brilliant closer Ã¢â‚¬ËœThere Is No TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) to heavy glam riffs and sneering vocals (on highlights Ã¢â‚¬ËœInside Your HeartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThey Told Me TooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) via straight-up garage-punk kicks (Ã¢â‚¬ËœYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The DoctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢), all welded together with a mix of feckless hedonism and the careering energy of a freight train. Lead single Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ begins with an angelic female harmony before erupting into sleazy stomps and dirty fuzz, while the amazingly titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœHandglamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes a grunge-tinged turn and is a mix of gnarly, angry sonics and bratty, sardonic vocals. Then you get Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove FuzzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, all eyelid-fluttering coyness and brilliantly dirgy riffs like Pond gone sexy; and the penultimate bow-out of Ã¢â‚¬ËœGold On The ShoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, full of acoustic twangs and stripped-back simplicity. It really is special. Because Ty Segall really is special. Please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let this one slip through the net.
