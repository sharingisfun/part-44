Finding himself lost and alone, he begins to realize that city life is not all he had imaginedÃ¢â‚¬â€until he meets the kindly Brown family, who read the label around his neck that says Ã¢â‚¬Å“Please look after this bear. Thank you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and offer him a temporary haven. It looks as though his luck has changed until this rarest of bears catches the eye of a museum taxidermist.\n\nDirector: Paul King\n\nWriters: Michael Bond, Paul King\n\nActors: Colin Firth, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, Peter Capaldi\n\nGenre: Family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89005dcb7afa65289d62ca4ae48c68699a5b6404","amp;dn":"Paddington.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%232+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89005dcb7afa65289d62ca4ae48c68699a5b6404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,0,93,203,122,250,101,40,157,98,202,74,228,140,104,105,154,91,100,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
