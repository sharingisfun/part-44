There they find a young woman by the name of Emily living in the house and they invite her to stay. When Jessica goes for a swim in the lake, she sees a body just below the water's surface. When they go into the village to sell some old furniture, they learn that a woman by the name of Abigail Stone drowned in the lake and her body was never found. Local folklore has that Abigail is now a vampire roaming the countryside. A mute blond girl leads her to the body of a dead man but the body is not there when Jessica goes for help. Jessica and those around begin to wonder if she is losing her mind.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067341/?ref_=sr_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067341/?ref_=sr_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3848dcd40c6c16f73f15572aadcd27af4cc1815c","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Scare+Jessica+to+Death+VHSrip+%5B.flv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3848dcd40c6c16f73f15572aadcd27af4cc1815c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,72,220,212,12,108,22,247,63,21,87,42,173,205,39,175,76,193,129,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
