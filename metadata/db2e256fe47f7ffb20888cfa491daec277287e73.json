It ends, 100 pages later, in the year 2000, with the death rattle of a 100-year-old man. The infant and the old man are both Julio, and Gilbert HernandezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JulioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day (originally serialized in Love and Rockets Vol. II but never completed until now) is his latest graphic novel, a masterpiece of elliptical, emotional storytelling that traces one life Ã¢â‚¬â€ indeed, one century in a human life Ã¢â‚¬â€ through a series of carefully crafted, consistently surprising and enthralling vignettes.\n\nThere is hope and joy, there is bullying and grief, there is war (so much war Ã¢â‚¬â€ this is after all the 20th century), there is love, there is heartbreak. While JulioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day has some settings and elements in common with HernandezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Palomar cycle (the Central American protagonists and milieu, the vivid characters, the strong familial and social ties), this is a very much a singular, standalone story that will help cement his position as one of the strongest and most original cartoonists of this, or any other, century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db2e256fe47f7ffb20888cfa491daec277287e73","amp;dn":"Julio%27s+Day+%7C+%28Gilbert+Hernandez%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db2e256fe47f7ffb20888cfa491daec277287e73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,46,37,111,228,127,127,251,32,136,140,250,73,29,174,194,119,40,126,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
