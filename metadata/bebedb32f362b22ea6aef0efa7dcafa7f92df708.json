Well, this is another similar soundtrack, from the same game publishing company, and the same composer, Danny Baranowski.\nWe've got heavy beats, a bit of techno rock, similar to Binding, with some humour chucked in.\n\nSupport the developers- if you like the soundtrack, try out the game for $15 on Steam, currently 75% off for steam summer sales, a worthy purchase.\n\nI haven't listed them as I usually do, as there is 70 tracks. \n\nOH, AND YES, THERE'S 70+ TRACKS! (79)\n\n\nHope You enjoy, if so, it's a small file so a little seeding won't hurt anyone ;)\n\nEnjoy and stay tuned for more like it!\n\nTedias.\n\nPS, if it doesn't work/ doesn't have all files, it means i've uploaded wrong, so let me know and ill fix and get back to ya1 ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bebedb32f362b22ea6aef0efa7dcafa7f92df708","amp;dn":"Super+Meat+Boy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bebedb32f362b22ea6aef0efa7dcafa7f92df708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,190,219,50,243,98,178,46,166,174,240,239,167,220,175,167,249,45,247,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
