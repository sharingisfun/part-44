Aircel Publishing) started as a Canadian publisher of comic books. Aircel Comics evolved from Aircel Insulation when the government pulled its contract with Aircel Insulation.[citation needed] Aircel started with Barry Blair, Dave Cooper, Patrick McEown, and Guang Yap. Illustrators such as Denis Beauvais and creators such as Dale Keown got their start at Aircel. Charles de Lint also scripted several comic books for Aircel in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Adventurers was a Fantasy Adventure (sword and sorcery) title that featured artwork by talents such as Peter Hsu, Kent Burles and others.\n\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources who as always wish to remain nameless.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ea0f5524464ddcf73a7bdd88f143557b140319","amp;dn":"Adventurers+%28Aircel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ea0f5524464ddcf73a7bdd88f143557b140319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,234,15,85,36,70,77,220,247,58,123,221,136,241,67,85,123,20,3,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
