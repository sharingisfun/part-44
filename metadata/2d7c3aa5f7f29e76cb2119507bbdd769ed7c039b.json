The two seasons of &quot;Higurashi&quot; functions like a mystery/detective novel, where the first season is about the horrifying event that transpired, and the second season is the solution where truths are revealed.\nBe warned that the two seasons have COMPLETELY different atmosphere and feel to them. The first season was a horror with plenty of violence and really creepy characters, but the second season is mainly drama with a lot more comedic relief.\n\n \n\nClick on image for full size view.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/3922/9ysm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img7/3922/9ysm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\nClick on image for full size view.\n \n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, AllEncoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7c3aa5f7f29e76cb2119507bbdd769ed7c039b","amp;dn":"Higurashi+no+naku+koro+ni+Kai+-+SE2+Complete+-+English+Sub+480p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7c3aa5f7f29e76cb2119507bbdd769ed7c039b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,124,58,165,247,242,158,118,203,33,25,80,123,189,215,105,237,124,3,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
