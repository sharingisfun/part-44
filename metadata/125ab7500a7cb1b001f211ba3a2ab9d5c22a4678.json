The band formed when self-taught musician Hubert Winston McIntosh (Peter Tosh) met Neville Livingston (Bunny Wailer), and Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) in 1963 and taught them how to play guitar, keyboards, and percussion. By late 1963 Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith had joined The Wailers. After Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the band in 1974, Bob Marley began touring with new band members. His new backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl &quot;Wya&quot; Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin &quot;Seeco&quot; Patterson on percussion. The &quot;I Threes&quot;, consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals.\n\nAlbums: Legend, Greatest Hits, Gold, Catch a Fire, Natty Dread, Burnin', Babylon by Bus, Confrontation, Survival, Kaya, Exodus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125ab7500a7cb1b001f211ba3a2ab9d5c22a4678","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+%26amp%3B+The+Wailers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125ab7500a7cb1b001f211ba3a2ab9d5c22a4678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,90,183,80,10,124,177,176,1,242,17,186,58,42,185,213,194,42,70,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
