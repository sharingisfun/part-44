But instead of oil, they discover a deposit of a hitherto unknown mineral.\n\nAmerican scientists working for Department of Defense find out that this mineral is in fact identical to the substance used to power an extraterrestrial artefact in their possession. This object is called the EON (Extraterrestrial Object Nexus).\n\nIt was found in 1919 by Colonel Emerson near the site of the Tunguska explosion. Emerson was the commander of a US military unit in charge of transporting US war supplies from the city of Vladivostok to the Eastern front during World War I.\n\nDoD Experiments have shown that items placed in the capsule are transported hundreds of thousands of years back in time. The American scientists were not able to understand its construction, nor could they manage to synthesise its fuel. Eventually, the machine - classified Top Secret - was stored, pending further advances in human science.\n\nThe experiments carried out with the new mineral, called siberite, discovered that in addition to its being the fuel for the EON, that it catalysed cold fusion.\n\nAs the Russian Federation itself was in a state of turmoil (which the original expedition was there trying to ease in the first place), there could be no guarantee that the leaders in Moscow would not use siberite to enslave other European nations, as well as their own scattered state once again.\n\nThe Americans therefore decided to act quickly. Using the EON, they began to send special units into the past to mine all of the siberite and transport it to the nearest territory under their control - to Alaska. However, the Russians learn about this plan, and they are not the only ones who don&amp;#039;t like it.\n\nNeither the brave and sympathetic John Macmillan, nor the proud and patriotic Yuri Ivanovich &quot;Burlak&quot; Gorky know what they are about to face on this adventure. Shall they follow their orders to the bitter end, or shall they try to find an escape from the vicious circle of destruction?\n\n\nOne thing however remains certain: they are going to change the history of mankind. How?\nWell, that depends on you.\nThe whole story is in section BONUS/VIDEO.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::ENJOY:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc380988280dccd3d2e8bd3dcb60ed45de79bd6","amp;dn":"ORIGINAL_WAR___%28mix+of+RTS+and+RPG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc380988280dccd3d2e8bd3dcb60ed45de79bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,195,128,152,130,128,220,205,61,46,139,211,220,182,14,212,93,231,155,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
