Today the Glock pistol has been \nembraced by two-thirds of all U.S. police departments, glamorized in \ncountless Hollywood movies, and featured as a ubiquitous presence on \nprime-time TV. It has been rhapsodized by hip-hop artists, and coveted \nby cops and crooks alike.\n\nCreated in 1982 by Gaston Glock, an obscure Austrian curtain-rod manufacturer, \nand swiftly adopted by the Austrian army, the Glock pistol, with its \nlightweight plastic frame and large-capacity spring-action magazine, \narrived in America at a fortuitous time. Law enforcement agencies had \nconcluded that their agents and officers, armed with standard six-round \nrevolvers, were getting outgunned by drug dealers with semi-automatic \npistols. They needed a new gun.\n\nWhen Karl Water, a firearm salesman based in the U.S. first saw a Glock \nin 1984, his reaction was, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJeez, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ugly.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But the advantages of \nthe pistol soon became apparent. The standard semi-automatic Glock could \nfire as many as 17 bullets from its magazine without reloading. (One \nequipped with an extended 33 cartridge magazine was used in Tucson to \nshoot Gabrielle Giffords and 19 others). It was built with only 36 parts \nthat were interchangeable with those of other models. You could drop \nit underwater, toss it from a helicopter, or leave it out in the snow, \nand it would still fire. It was reliable, accurate, lightweight, and \ncheaper to produce than Smith and WessonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revolver. Made in part of \nhardened plastic, it was even rumored (incorrectly) to be invisible \nto airport security screening.\n\nFilled with corporate intrigue, political maneuvering, Hollywood glitz, \nbloody shoot-outs - and an attempt on Gaston GlockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life by a former \nlieutenant - Glock is at once the inside account of how Glock the company \nwent about marketing its pistol to police agencies and later the public, \nas well as a compelling chronicle of the evolution of gun culture in \nAmerica.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a74d63251064cfb821d85e516bdc289570f72cb","amp;dn":"Glock%3A+The+Rise+of+Americas+Gun+%28Audio+Book%2C+mp3+64+CBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a74d63251064cfb821d85e516bdc289570f72cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,116,214,50,81,6,76,251,130,29,133,229,22,189,194,137,87,15,114,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
