With his friend Capella, a\n      super-strong antique collector, he thwarts the offbeat schemes of a\n      variety of mad scientists. A recurring adversary is 'Casimir Boudu', a\n      meek-looking old man who is in reality a peace-loving, blue-skinned\n      alien whose mission is to slow down Earth's technological progress. &quot; \n\nOVERVIEW (French):   &lt;a href=&quot; http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Magellan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Magellan&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOVERVIEW (Dutch):    &lt;a href=&quot; http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Magellan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Magellan&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCONTAINS:\n\n   8 (out of 8) graphic novels and 38/29 (out of 39/30) short stories, for the\n   French/Dutch versions, respectively. All of them were originally published in\n   serialized format in &quot;Journal Tintin&quot;/&quot;Kuifje weekblad&quot; from 1969 thru 1979, and\n   all of the long and most of the short stories were later re-printed in dedicated\n   graphic albums. The French scans originate from the latter throughout, and are of\n   consistently high quality. The Dutch scans originate mostly from the latter, too,\n   however with a fair portion of the shorts filled in as direct extracts from\n   &quot;Kuifje&quot; magazine; many of the scans unfortunately seem to be based on visibly\n   aged and degraded copies - never to the point of illegibility, though.
