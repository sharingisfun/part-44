Weaving together the insights of keen believers like Fr. Richard Neuhaus, Caryll Houselander, Archbishop Fulton Sheen, and Dr. James Edwards, these powerful meditations take us into the depths of Christ's agony, and back out again into the relief and joy of what His sacrifice means for us.\n\nFiletype: MP3\nLength: 01:11:18\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/glimpses-along-the-way-of-the-cross&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/glimpses-along-the-way-of-the-cross&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
