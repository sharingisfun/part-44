SATURATE's success proved them right, though. A melting pot of post-grunge riffs, nu-metal power, and classic rock accessibility, Breaking Benjamin offers something for hard rock fans of all stripes. Melodic choruses and signature riffs rub shoulders with screeching, from-the-gut vocals and amps-on-11 guitar firestorms. By paying homage to all their influences simultaneously, the band seems to have come up with a hard-hitting sound whose whole is greater than the sum of its already-impressive parts on BB's chart-bound debut album SATURATE.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9235ec752fad310dcc374dec38bc5df1eb593a00","amp;dn":"Breaking_Benjamin-Saturate-2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9235ec752fad310dcc374dec38bc5df1eb593a00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,53,236,117,47,173,49,13,204,55,77,236,56,188,93,241,235,89,58,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
