Katherine is a manager at a luxury hotel, a job sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d intended to leave years ago, and is separated from her husband. The novel unfolds in 2006, at the end of the money-for-nothing years, as a chance meeting leads to an awkward tryst and James tries to make sense of a relationship where Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means Ã¢â‚¬Å“maybeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can never be taken for granted.\n\nDavid Szalay builds a novel of immense resonance as he cycles though perspectives that add layers of depth to the hesitations, missteps, and tensions as James tries to win Katherine. JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other pursuit is money, and Spring follows his investments and schemes, from a half share in a thoroughbred to a suit-and-tie day job heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken to pay the bills. Spring is a sharply tuned novel so nuanced and precise in its psychology that it establishes Szalay as a major talent.\nGenre: Literary Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465ff06f68b1943953fde33e3e29481fd6f6fe37","amp;dn":"Spring+A+Novel+by+David+Szalay.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465ff06f68b1943953fde33e3e29481fd6f6fe37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,95,240,111,104,177,148,57,83,253,227,62,62,41,72,31,214,246,254,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
