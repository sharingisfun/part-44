Matters reach breaking point and his colleagues attempt to obtain an ASBO against him, a device usually reserved for vandals and other persistent low level offenders. Rumpole not only has to cope with that, but also to worry about Hilda's growing friendship with a High Court judge, whose motives may not be totally honest.\n\nIn part two, having successfully fended off the ASBO, Rumpole defends a murderer, notwithstanding how this may impact on his chances of becoming a QC and thus able to lead in major cases, rather than having to be second string to one of his less able colleagues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f1e3d49e5a045eb76595e78a471ece20635c81","amp;dn":"The+Antisocial+Behavious+of+Horace+Rumpole+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f1e3d49e5a045eb76595e78a471ece20635c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,241,227,212,158,90,4,94,183,101,149,231,138,71,30,206,32,99,92,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
