Narrated by Leonard Graves and set to a score by Richard Rodgers, this program offered a remarkable look at the realities of naval warfare and the extraordinary challenges faced by the Allies. From U-boat &quot;wolf packs&quot; to the epic battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, every major naval engagement of World War II is captured in some of the most riveting combat footage ever shot.\n\n\n\n\n23)  Target Suribachi \nThe United States fought two battles here-the U.S. Marines at Iwo Jima against the Japanese, and the U.S. Navy against the typhoon. During the now-legendary events depicted in this episode, the series reaches the final throes of battle in the Pacific war against the Japanese. And as the scene of the recent Mount Suribachi memorial appears, viewers are once again reminded of the price that comes before true victory can be achieved.\n\n24)  The Road to Mandalay \nThe Japanese invade China in 1936, but the Japanese are not satisfied and they invade Indochina and Thailand, enabling the invasion of Burma. The U.S. and British navies nurture their relations with the Indian Navy as supplies are built for the return. Eventually, it was decided to build a road to link with the Burma Road, and with human and elephant power, they succeeded. Eventually, they &quot;came back to Mandalay&quot;, and the first supplies travelled the road to hordes of cheering Chinese.\n\n25)  Suicide for Glory \nIn a last effort at glory, having lost most of their best men in military actions, Japan employs suicide pilots-the Kamikaze-men who willingly crash their planes into ships in order to destroy the American spirit. But the U.S. Navy and Marines are ready for them with their guns, and they fought heroically against the onslaught. And on Okinawa, Americans fight a major battle with the Japanese Army.\n\n26)  Design for Peace \nThe atomic bomb is detonated, and its effects demonstrated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With that, the Japanese surrender, and their diplomats and military officials sign the official surrender documents aboard the USS Missouri. The U.S. armed forces come home to signs saying, &quot;Welcome Home&quot; before they are greeted by mothers, wives, children and fellow neighbours. But before the series is ended, there is one last parade to march in their honor.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3286/67l9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3286/67l9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9752/0tz0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9752/0tz0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1628/mxe6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1628/mxe6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2465/judp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2465/judp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/3457/p6rh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/3457/p6rh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/285/q34b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/285/q34b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2388/7krt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2388/7krt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/795/0ute.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/795/0ute.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9605/etpq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9605/etpq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1029 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 544\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 27.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 26\n * Part Size: average 232 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Sea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Sea&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:938d7aa1892d335a44c88281b363f190d9668179","amp;dn":"Victory+At+Sea+23of26+Target+Suribachi+DVDRip+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"938d7aa1892d335a44c88281b363f190d9668179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,141,122,161,137,45,51,90,68,200,130,129,179,99,241,144,217,102,129,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
