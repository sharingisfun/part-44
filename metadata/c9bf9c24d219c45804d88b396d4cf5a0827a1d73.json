The sound quality on the recording is decent, but a few things before you decide if you want to download it or not.\n\n1. The first 3 songs have very low/no vocals due to technical difficulties at the venue, which you can hear people around us getting frustrated by, and you can hear Buddy after the third song shout &quot;we'll be right back&quot; while the staff tries to solve the problem.\n\n2. When they finally did solve the vocal problems (after about 15 minutes), Buddy played one song and then brought out Quinn Sullivan, a 12 year old guitar prodigy that has been touring with Buddy recently. Now, he is very talented, but he plays more than Buddy during the show, and while I get Buddy is getting up there in years, it was disappointing that we got more of Quinn than Buddy. I would have rather seen Buddy play for 45 minutes to an hour first and then let Quinn come out so people can at least get their fill of Buddy.\n\n3. I do not drink, but I really don't have a problem with people who drink at concerts, but you'd think some people view the concert as background to their coversation. I was unforunate enough to be in front of a group of 4 people who really didn't stop talking throughout the whole show, and you can even hear a few people around me asking them to stop at some points. I turned around and literally they were in a circle and two of the people had their backs to the stage and were in conversation and just loud and drunk throughout the whole show. I just don't get the point of going to a concert and ruining everyone else's experience because you decided to have a few too many. Go to a bar if your main objective is to get as drunk as possible and yell over the music.\n\nAnyways, seeing Buddy was great, the guy is a legend, but it was definitely a disappointing experience and I probably would have walked out if it wouldn't have been someone of Buddy's stature.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9bf9c24d219c45804d88b396d4cf5a0827a1d73","amp;dn":"Buddy+Guy-+2011-7-16%2C+Lakefront+Park%2C+Prior+Lake%2C+MN+%28AUD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9bf9c24d219c45804d88b396d4cf5a0827a1d73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,191,156,36,210,25,196,88,4,216,139,57,109,76,245,160,130,122,29,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
