Then you will get right into\r\ncreating animations for your character, first controlling\r\nanimation with your mouse and other keyboard controls\r\nrecording the animation, and even using your webcam to\r\ncontrol the animation of your character. There is so much\r\nmore in this in depth tutorial so that in the end, you will\r\nbe on your way to creating your first animation with\r\nCharacter Animator!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde40711c9d64902c9b3fe8ce7a110baf8b9299a","amp;dn":"Train+Simple+After+Effects+CC+Character+Animator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde40711c9d64902c9b3fe8ce7a110baf8b9299a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,228,7,17,201,214,73,2,201,179,254,140,231,161,16,186,248,185,41,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
