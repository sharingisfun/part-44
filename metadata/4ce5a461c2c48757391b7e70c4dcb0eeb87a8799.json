Dynamic Immersion empowers you to see, hear and comprehend without translating or memorizing. You already have this ability. Rosetta Stone simply unlocks it.  \n\n\nEngage Interactively\nGet feedback to move forward. You learn best by doing, and you'll apply what you've learned to get to the next step.

So you'll keep using it, and you'll learn more! \n\nThat's language-learning success.\nThat's Rosetta Stone. \nNo translation or memorization required.\n\nThe most effective way to learn a new language is to be surrounded by it. When you were an infant, your parents taught you this way, by intuitively associating words with images. That's the ultimate language lab, but most language-learning programs completely ignore this. \n\nThink about all of the ways you've tried to learn a language: classes at school, tapes and cassettes, even software that uses your native language as a base for your next one. What do they all have in common? Translation and memorization. \n\nInstead of taking a &quot;direct flight&quot; from your brain to your new language, translation and memorization connects you to your old language. You always have to &quot;fly&quot; from your brain, to your native tongue ... and then translate what you've memorized to communicate. \n\nThat might work for a few words, but what happens when you get to a sentence or phrase? When you have to change tenses? You're going to make a lot of &quot;connecting flights.&quot; That's why those other methods are so frustrating ... and why they fail. \n\nEnter Dynamic Immersion.\nThis method encourages you to think like a baby. You'll pair words with vivid, real-life images and make connections between things you know and the new language. Soon, you'll be thinking in a new language, stringing words together into phrases that you create. \n\nInnovative technology.\nRosetta Stone places this Dynamic Immersion method at the core of a suite of software that works with you to develop your skills. The simple, intuitive interface helps to keep you engaged in the solution, while advanced speech recognition technology makes certain that you're speaking correctly and accurately. Best of all, Rosetta Stone never leaves you behind. You'll only move forward when you're ready, when you've become comfortable and confident.
