    Grind is an adult film  company that wants Jody to  edit their\n        new  film,  Finding Bliss.  She  soon finds  she  has all  the\n        facilities needed to make her own heart-felt romantic movie on\n        the sly,  so she  edits porn  by day  and films  her storybook\n        romance by night... until she gets caught.\n\n        Rather than being fired, Jody is allowed to use the facilities\n        if she  re-writes their  lacklustre porn  script and  turns it\n        into an  art-house movie.  But during  the re-write,  Jody and\n        director Jeff (Matt Davis) form an unlikely relationship.\n\n        Determined to  let nothing  stand in  her way,  Jody befriends\n        Laura  (Denise  Richards), the  star  of the  movie,  and soon\n        realises that life  is a classic  struggle between good  girls\n        and bad boys, art and commerce, idealism and selling out. \n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                   Leelee Sobieski   ....
