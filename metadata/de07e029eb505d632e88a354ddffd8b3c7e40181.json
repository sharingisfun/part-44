That all changes after a devastating terrorist suicide bombing and his beloved wife, Siham, is found among the dead as the primary suspect. Although initially refusing to accept that as Shin Bet interrogates him, Amin comes to realize the allegations are true. Now, the ostracized Amin resolves to find out on his own why Siham had so strong a conviction that she kept secret from him. However, the answers prove hard to come by and the truths involved have a terrible pain of their own.\n\n\nLanguages: Arabic / Hebrew\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de07e029eb505d632e88a354ddffd8b3c7e40181","amp;dn":"The+Attack+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de07e029eb505d632e88a354ddffd8b3c7e40181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,7,224,41,235,80,93,99,46,136,163,84,221,255,216,179,199,228,1,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
