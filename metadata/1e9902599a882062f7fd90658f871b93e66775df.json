Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson\r\nDIRECTOR......: Sofia Coppola\r\nWRITERS.......: Sofia Coppola\r\nGENRE.........: Drama\r\nRATING........: 7.8/10 313,026 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 89\r\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 41mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.08 GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1040\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3-Pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\r\nSOURCE........: French Blu Ray Remux\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-03-22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1lptogol6/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9902599a882062f7fd90658f871b93e66775df","amp;dn":"Lost.In.Translation.2003.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9902599a882062f7fd90658f871b93e66775df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,153,2,89,154,136,32,98,247,253,144,101,143,135,27,147,230,103,117,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
