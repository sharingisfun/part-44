He is the brother of Neal Morse, who left the band in 2002. Alan has recorded with many artists including Chad and Jeremy, Spencer Davis, Neal Morse, and (Spock's Beard keyboardist) Ryo Okumoto. Along with the guitar, he sings and plays the theremin, the cello, musical saw, keyboards, drums, bass &amp; bouzouki. Morse has a degree in electrical \nengineering and owns anelectronics manufacturing company, DynaMetric, Inc. Unusual for a rock guitar player, Morse does not use a pick. Alan completed his first solo album, Four O'Clock &amp; Hysteria, which released on April 24, 2007 on InsideOut Music. Musicians for this album include all of Spock's Beard original line-up, and Alan's brother, Neal, also co-wrote with him several tracks. \n\nGenre: Jazz-rock fusion\nQuality: MP3 CBR at 320 kbps\nEncoder: Lame 3.98r\nEncoded with dBpoweramp and ID tags and playlist with Mp3tag v. 2.43\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.
