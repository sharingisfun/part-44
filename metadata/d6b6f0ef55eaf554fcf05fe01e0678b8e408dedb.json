It was released in the United Kingdom (UK) by EMI Records in March 1994, and shortly after in the United States (US) by Columbia Records.\n\nWritten mostly by guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright, the album deals mostly with themes of communication. Recording took place in a number of locations, including the band's Britannia Row Studios, and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria. The production team included Pink Floyd stalwarts such as producer Bob Ezrin, engineer Andy Jackson, and saxophonist Dick Parry. Gilmour's new wife, Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the album's lyrics, and Wright performed his first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since 1973's The Dark Side of\nthe Moon.\n\nThe album went to number one in the UK and the US, but received lukewarm reviews. Its release was followed immediately by a tour of the US and Europe. The Division Bell was certified Gold, Platinum, and Double Platinum in the US in June 1994, and triple Platinum in January 1999. The album sold over 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Cluster one                                          [05:58]\n02.What do you want form me                             [04:22]\n03.Poles apart                                          [07:04]\n04.Marooned                                             [05:30]\n05.A great day for freedom                              [04:18]\n06.Wearing the inside out                               [06:50]\n07.Take it back                                         [06:12]\n08.Coming back to life                                  [06:19]\n09.Keep talking                                         [06:11]\n10.Lost for words                                       [05:15]\n11.High hopes                                           [08:32]\n____\n\n66:31 min\n 95,4 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6b6f0ef55eaf554fcf05fe01e0678b8e408dedb","amp;dn":"Pink_Floyd-The_Division_Bell-%28Retail%29-1994-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6b6f0ef55eaf554fcf05fe01e0678b8e408dedb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,182,240,239,85,234,245,84,252,240,95,224,30,6,120,184,228,8,222,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
