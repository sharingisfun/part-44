Exciting because of the music that could constantly be heard around the families' homes near Robin Hood's Bay, on the Yorkshire coast, but difficult because of the expectations. Marry and Oliver are the children of that bravely original songwriter and singer, the late Lal Waterson, a fan of Van Morrison and Kate Bush who saw herself as being &quot;beyond a folk-singer&quot;. Here, they continue her tradition on their second album together, a concept set that deals with themes of &quot;concealment, deception and avoidance&quot;. Marry's vocal style is no-nonsense, sometimes deadpan, but effectively varied, switching from the bleak balladry of Starveling (&quot;dressed to kill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who was dead?&quot;) to the jaunty music hall of Scarlet Scarlet, exploring the vulnerability of a stage performer, or the sly humour of Russian Dolls. Brother Oliver adds acoustic and electric guitars, and there are guest appearances from their cousin Eliza Carthy, adding jazz-edged vocals on Going Going Gone, and uncle Martin Carthy on guitar. Like their mother's work, it sounds better each time you play it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e464b184fc9f5a95f5f12706e6d8b222c0e17ec8","amp;dn":"Marry+Waterson+and+Oliver+Knight+-+Hidden+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e464b184fc9f5a95f5f12706e6d8b222c0e17ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,100,177,132,252,159,90,149,245,241,39,6,230,216,178,34,192,225,126,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
