Its president, Mino Arakawa, was stuck with two thousand unsold arcade cabinets for a dud of a game (Radar Scope). So he hatched a plan. \n  \nBack in Japan, a boyish, shaggy-haired staff artist named Shigeru Miyamoto designed a new game for the unsold cabinets featurÃ‚Â­ing an angry gorilla and a small jumping man. Donkey Kong brought in $180 million in its first year alone and launched the career of a short, chubby plumber named Mario. \n  \nSince then, Mario has starred in over two hundred games, genÃ‚Â­erating profits in the billions. He is more recognizable than Mickey Mouse, yet heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little more than a mustache in bib overalls. How did a mere smear of pixels gain such huge popularity? \nSuper Mario tells the story behind the Nintendo games millions of us grew up with, explaining how a Japanese trading card company rose to dominate the fiercely competitive video-game industry.
