But this is a good thing cause if you like Stevie Ray Vaughn Moore had all the weapons to hang with him and others well enough of my rambling. Im gonna make Gary Moore and some others like projects in my up loads with some dialogue ect. but not all wikiDRY I lived through the times not just read about them or was told the 70s 80s and 90s were a wild time to be alive and partying I did some roadie work,some security gigs for different promotors, good times......Anyway...format mp3 bitrate 320kbps CDRip done by me Enjoy and seed this cause these talents are droping like flies if not already fallen.. and Im yet to get one day younger Damn it.
