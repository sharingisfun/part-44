Stripped of its nosebleed-section bleat, the band storms out of the gates with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Leaving Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a spirited romp that will likely draw comparisons to fellow countrymen Frightened Rabbit. The songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s build feels organic, and it dutifully sets the tone for what follows, even if what follows is fairly forgettable, despite the fact that the band obviously really, really wants to connect. Folk and country-tinged midtempo cuts like &quot;Dia Dos Namarados!,&quot; &quot;The Motorcycle Boy Reigns,&quot; and &quot;I Used to Dream&quot; are pretty enough, but outside of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Leaving SongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the delightful, road trip-ready ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Darkness Rises Up,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Let Me Come Home never really develops into the lump in the throat it wants to be, though it certainly isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t for lack of trying. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/broken-records/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5c3a3d06b703fdd882fb3c4c64fae9b720c140","amp;dn":"Broken+Records...Let+Me+Come+Home%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5c3a3d06b703fdd882fb3c4c64fae9b720c140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,92,58,61,6,183,3,253,216,130,251,60,76,100,250,233,183,32,193,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
