I think it was the last time that they were taking shots at the corporate world. Before they became it. Anyway I threw these 2 out there cause they sounded so good that I had to have them somewhere in my pages. Thanks to vtwin88cube  CD rip of this. I still have the cassette but that don't help much anymore","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8917d186ff46622d3668e6a6b1b5478c591a566","amp;dn":"+U2+-+Bullet+the+Blue+Sky+%26amp%3B+Van+Diemens+Land%28Singles%29+320k+m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8917d186ff46622d3668e6a6b1b5478c591a566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,145,125,24,111,244,102,34,211,102,142,106,107,27,84,120,197,145,165,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
