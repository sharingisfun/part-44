Through 2004 and 2005 buzz on the band's live shows lead to performances with an impressively diverse group of artists, from Philip Glass and Steve Reich, to Feist. In the summer of 2006, they were even invited on a European tour with the late James Brown, a fitting last leg to the first chapter of their story. 'Close to Paradise' was released immediately after, in September 2006.\n\n\n01. Just Another Ordinary Day\n02. Woods\n03. Mary&quot;\n04. Silent City\n05. Shame\n06. Brigette's Theme\n07.
