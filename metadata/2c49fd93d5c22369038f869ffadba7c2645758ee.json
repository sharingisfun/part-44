Ollie has a life-threatening allergy to electricity, and Moritz's weak heart requires a pacemaker. If they ever did meet, they could both die. Living as recluses from society, the boys develop a fierce bond through letters that become a lifeline during dark times-as Ollie loses his only friend, Liz, to the normalcy of high school and Moritz deals with a bully set on destroying him. But when Moritz reveals the key to their shared, sinister past that began years ago in a mysterious German laboratory, their friendship faces a test neither one of them expected. \n \n\nNarrated in letter form by Ollie and Moritz-two extraordinary new voices-this story of impossible friendship and hope under strange circumstances blends elements of science fiction with coming of age themes, in a humorous, dark, and ultimately inspiring tale is completely unforgettable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c49fd93d5c22369038f869ffadba7c2645758ee","amp;dn":"Because+You%27ll+Never+Meet+Me+-+Leah+Thomas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c49fd93d5c22369038f869ffadba7c2645758ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,73,253,147,213,194,35,105,3,143,134,159,250,219,167,194,100,87,88,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
