So after the app downloads SD Data or OBB Data make a backup copy just in case they update or change versions which might change or disrupted were data downloads from. Then you will still have files encase u would like to reinstall or share without having to download though the app.(srry I didn't see a reason to post SD Data when it's still the working current version &quot;Don't fix what isn't broke&quot; be sides someone else can post OBB Data if needed)\n\n\nMore Info: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.shadowgun_thd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.shadowgun_thd&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c89dd086e0c1c67f3f9e765e45390c1790dd9e8b","amp;dn":"SHADOWGUN+THD+v1.1.2.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c89dd086e0c1c67f3f9e765e45390c1790dd9e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,157,208,134,224,193,198,127,63,158,118,94,69,57,12,23,144,221,158,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
