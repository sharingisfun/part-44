The former magician often takes solace in the bottle and barely ekes a living as a cleaner in a nightclub. He has a 10-year-old son he desperately loves, but sorrow, guilt and constant inebriation have made him an ineffectual father. The son (Jathishweran) is a stoic old soul who has learned to bury his affection for his old man and to cope with his chaotic life. \n \nA broken spirit and a single parent, Francis hopes to redeem himself and win his son's love and respect. He makes a painful - and bizarre - return to magic. An unexpected incident one night sets father and son on the road. In a dilapidated building, these two wounded souls come to terms with their love which is as deep and acute as their grief.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c421abccc1e507041d4a2bb66ca909f169ce71","amp;dn":"My+magic+-+Eric+Khoo+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c421abccc1e507041d4a2bb66ca909f169ce71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,196,33,171,204,193,229,7,4,29,74,43,182,108,169,9,241,105,206,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
