In fact, it could have been called Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Guide to CÃƒÂ©zanneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Likes and Dislikes in Painting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ CÃƒÂ©zanneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likes and dislikes are not simply a reflection of his personal taste but a reflection of an age-old debate in the history of art . Une Visite au Louvre does not include film clips or photographs. Instead, closely following the Gasquet text, they show us fifteen works of art, one of which is a sculpture (the Nike of Samothrace) and the rest paintings. At the end of his life, CÃƒÂ©zanne remarked that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Louvre is the book from which we learn to read,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and in his study of the human form he often made drawings of sculptures in the Louvre.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade1c54e809631f879b36f19cabeecec4685dd90","amp;dn":"Une+Visite+au+Louvre+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade1c54e809631f879b36f19cabeecec4685dd90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,225,197,78,128,150,49,248,121,179,111,25,202,190,236,236,70,133,221,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
