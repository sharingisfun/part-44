It works as a survey of 78-rpm era bass players, certainly, including cuts from Bill Johnson, Walter Page, Al Morgan, and many others, but due to its wide-ranging inclusion of jazz, swing, blues, country, jug band, Western swing, and gospel material, it can also work as a wonderfully upbeat set of vintage American roots music, and one doesn't necessarily need to be a string bass player or music historian to get into it.\n\nIt isn't a collection of bass solos, either, although there are plenty of those scattered through the tunes, but is rather a look at how this instrument was used in a wide variety of settings. Among the high points are &quot;Dinah&quot; by Jean Goldkette &amp; His Orchestra, a funky &quot;Bull Frog Blues&quot; by Charles Pierce &amp; His Orchestra, a blistering &quot;Tex's Dance&quot; from the Prairie Ramblers, a delightfully loose version of &quot;Mama Don't Allow&quot; called &quot;Don't 'Low&quot; from Washboard Sam, and two takes by the Midnight Rounders of &quot;Bull Fiddle Rag.&quot; Fun from start to finish, How Low Can You Go? is like a great cross-genre American barn dance in a box. Another great set from Dust-to-Digital.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac52d93fb2d534ccf7ab92763367d974db110a6","amp;dn":"How+Low+Can+You+Go+-+Anthology+Of+The+String+Bass+%283-CD%2C+1925-19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac52d93fb2d534ccf7ab92763367d974db110a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,197,45,147,251,45,83,76,207,122,185,39,99,54,125,151,77,177,16,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
