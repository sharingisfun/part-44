Jerome has written almost 30 books of fiction and nonfiction, including the #1 New York Times best-selling TOM CLANCY'S POWER PLAYS series. His baseball blog, Deep in the Red, for the New York Yankees' YESNetwork.com, is among the most popular professional sports blogs on the Internet. He is currently writing his second original novel based on the hit TV series, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Once the floral designer for the legendary restaurant, La CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´te Basque, Suzanne Preisler is co-author of two crime/mystery series. Besides their GRIME SOLVERS mysteries, she and Jerome are presently working on the first book in their NASHVILLE KATZ series for Kensington. They divide their time between Manhattan and coastal New England.\n\n1. Scene of the Grime (2007)\nIn her mid-30s and recently widowed, Sky Taylor left the big city for Pigeon Cove, a hamlet off the Massachusetts coast. Sky is re-adapting to single lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€with a newspaper column and her knack for creative cleaning increasingly in demand. Then she discovers a patron of the Millwood Inn permanently checked out. Now Sky's juggling the police chief's questions with advances from the newestÃ¢â‚¬â€and handsomestÃ¢â‚¬â€crime reporter in town. But if she wants to clear her name, she has some scouring to do.\n\n2. Dirty Deeds (2008)\nBetween her newspaper column and her cleaning clients, cleaning wiz Sky Taylor is on her way to a stable, self-sufficient life. All she needs now is a contract to clean City Hall. What she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need is another messy murder investigation. What does she get? Both. The body of Kyle Fipps, real estate developer and wannabe actor, is the untidiest remnant of the Art AssociationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual holiday bash. With his pack of scheming enemies and a smattering of even less trustworthy friends, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very likely he was murdered. But when the investigation leads straight to City Hall, will Sky be the next one getting swept under the rug?\n\n3. Notoriously Neat (2009)\nProfessional cleaner Sky Taylor and her potential new beauÃ¢â‚¬â€the town's police chiefÃ¢â‚¬â€are on their first dinner date when they're interrupted by a stampede of household pets running through the restaurant. Someone's murdered Dr. Gail Pilsner, Pigeon Cove's hugely popular veterinarian, releasing all the critters boarded at her clinic. Then when one of the singers in a vocal group, the La Dee Das, is murdered, Sky tries to uncover the link between the veterinarian and the songbirdsÃ¢â‚¬â€before a killer finishes cleaning house.\nSharing Widget","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:234828f529b95f90a24b3352ac2700d570623526","amp;dn":"Grime+Solvers+Mystery+Series+-+Suzanne+Price","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"234828f529b95f90a24b3352ac2700d570623526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,72,40,245,41,185,95,144,162,75,51,82,172,39,0,213,112,98,53,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
