The Gershwin estate gave Wilson access to rare, unfinished pieces of music by George Gershwin, with which Brian crafted collaborative compositions unlike anything the world has heard with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Like in I Love YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothing But LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Wilson chose to record George and Ira Gershwin songs because he considers the late composers of classics like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomeone to Watch Over Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRhapsody in BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummertimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a critical influence on him.\nBrian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin was produced by Brian Wilson and mixed by Al Schmitt the 15-time GRAMMY award winner (Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Ray Charles, Barbra Streisand, Madonna)\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/2dc2/282461ea.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n# Rhapsody In Blue\n# The Like In I Love You\n# Summertime\n# I Love You Porgy\n# I Got Plenty Of Nothin\\'\n# It Ain\\'t Necessarily So\n# \\'S Wonderful\n# They Can\\'t Take That Away From Me\n# Our Love Is Here To Stay\n# I\\'ve Got A Crush On You\n# I Got Rhythm\n# Someone To Watch Over Me\n# Nothing But Love\n\n[IMG]http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j81/wrcfoucs/watching3vemq8.gif[/IMG]\n[img]http://i487.photobucket.com/albums/rr240/allan1959_2008/3acc2b6eseedball.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1bb9c075aa0b4fe30222dc20f69e37b5c72b003","amp;dn":"Brian+Wilson+-+Brian+Wilson+Reimagines+Gershwin%28split+tracks+%2B+c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1bb9c075aa0b4fe30222dc20f69e37b5c72b003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,187,156,7,90,160,180,254,48,34,45,194,15,105,227,123,92,114,176,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
