While dining with business associates on the roof of his Mirror Group HQ, he invites them to join him in taking a leak over the edge of the high-rise building. \\&quot;Don\\&amp;#039;t the people below notice?\\&quot; someone asks. \\&quot;No-one notices anything!\\&quot; Maxwell replies cheerily, something he might also be saying of his shady approach to business and the plunder of his employees\\&amp;#039; pension funds. David Suchet brilliantly captures the ursine pomp of Maxwell and his fruity growl. (Given Bafta\\&amp;#039;s fondness for impressions - six of the eight acting nominations this year are for real-life roles - he\\&amp;#039;ll do well next year.) He also conveys the desperation that sets in as Maxwell\\&amp;#039;s business empire starts to unravel and he becomes a haunted figure, bugging his own staff and pursuing his secretary (My Family\\&amp;#039;s Daniela Denby-Ashe, also superb). It\\&amp;#039;s a memorable performance in a gripping tale of business chicanery on a grand scale. One quibble: whoever thought of casting the wide-eyed Dan Stevens (from The Line of Beauty) as a city finance director needs to get out more. \n\n\nFile Information: \n\nDVBT-T (Freeview) Capture\nConverted using Gordian Knot\nResolution = 512x272\nVideo Codec = XviD\nAudio = 128kbps CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a913c06d113b8f8a4f987c2a0ee30df38233f9","amp;dn":"UK+-+BBC+Drama+-+Maxwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a913c06d113b8f8a4f987c2a0ee30df38233f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,169,19,192,109,17,59,143,138,79,152,124,42,14,227,13,243,130,51,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
