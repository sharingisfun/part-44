It sounds like a track that could have been on 'Fat of the Land' and since that is their BEST album it only makes sense that any likeness to it would sell a record. But it doesn't end there. Another favorite is 'Memphis Bells' which uses the 'bells' perfectly to create a masterpiece gone arry. The guest stars are a perfect choice, from Juliette Lewis on 'Hot Ride' and Twista (my personal favorite) spitting fury on 'Get Up Get Off'. The ode to Michael Jacksons 'Thriller' is apparent on 'The Way it Is' but Prodigy manages to make something new and different out of it, not just recycling it but acually reimagining it. 'Phoenix' is another standout track that takes advantage of the indian vibe and 'Action Radar's &quot;a little action is all i need&quot; will get the mood right (and is it just me or does she sound like Shirley Manson? I mean, this sounds like a track that could have come out on Garbage's 2.0) ANyways, buy this album, it's that good![/quote]\n[image=sPiRzWpaT7]]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Prodigy, The - Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Prodigy, The\nAlbum................: Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2004\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 284kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
