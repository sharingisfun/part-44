It features sixty ~1 minute clips of music videos with short clips in between. Drink when the numbers show up in the bottom corner. It's got a quick intro so don't freak out just because the drinking doesn't start until ~1 minute in.\n\nFile format is .mkv for ripping efficiency and file size. If you want to play it on your xbox or something, mencoder is a good gui for creating good quality copies of other file types (avi, mpeg, whatever).\n\nI won't list every song b/c that would take too long and ruin any surprise factor. For the purpose of deciding if you'll like the general vibe of the power hour, here are some of the artists featured (it's a mix of genres):\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\nVampire Weekend\nAC/DC\nHall and Oates\nThe Dandy Warhols\nMGMT\nReel Big Fish\nTom Petty\nBeck\nWeezer\nThe Beatles\nGorillaz\nSublime\nJamiroquai\nThe Raconteurs\nGnarls Barkley\nKool and the Gang\nWolfmother\nLed Zeppelin\nFatboy Slim\nFlogging Molly\nThe Hives\nOK Go\nTenacious D\nQueen\n\nAnd that should give you a good idea of the musical style.\n\nDrink somewhat responsibly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:983eb78f413188b0bacb81857943f669d01422a2","amp;dn":"Power+Hour+3+%28PH3%29+-+Dear+Diary+%28mixed+genres%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"983eb78f413188b0bacb81857943f669d01422a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,62,183,143,65,49,136,176,186,203,129,133,121,67,246,105,208,20,34,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
