ACID ROCK AND PSYCHODELIC POP &amp; ROCK \n\nPsychedelic rock evolved in the 60s as an offshoot of the rock and roll movement combining elements of pop,rock, electronic music, eastern influences - particularly sitars, and other diverse elements. Inspired by the use of mind altering drugs like cannabis, mescaline, psilocybin, and especially LSD, psychedelic rock broke with traditional rock and laid the roots for Krautrock and experimental rock genres of the seventies and eighties.\nPsychedelic pop is a musical style inspired by the harder, louder songs of psychedelic rock but applied more to a pop music setting.\nPsychedelic music could be interpreted as simply a &quot;surreal and dreamy feeling&quot; in a particular song, instead of a specific genre with rules to follow. In some cases, this simply requires writing one coherent song, then to experiment recording that song in the studio while under &quot;psychedelic influence&quot;, yielding very surreal musical results.\nDuring the 1960s, pychedelic rock dominated the later half of the decade with bands such as Pink Floyd , Traffic ,The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience obtaining success.\nAcid rock is a form of psychedelic rock, which is characterized with long instrumental solos, few (if any) lyrics and musical improvisation. Tom Wolfe describes the LSD-influenced music of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Iron Butterfly, Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company, Cream, The Velvet Underground, Jefferson Airplane, Ultimate Spinach, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Blue Cheer, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Great Society, Stone Garden and the Grateful Dead as &quot;acid rock&quot; in his book about Ken Kesey and the Acid Tests, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. \n\n\nPINK FLOYD - Arnold Layne (1967) \nPINK FLOYD - The Scarecrow (1967)\nPINK FLOYD - See Emily Play (1967)\nTHE TROGGS - Night of the long grass (1967)\nEPISODE SIX - Morning Dew (1967)\nEPISODE SIX - I hear Trumpets Blow (1967)\nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ White Rabbit ( 1967)\nTHE BEATLES - I AM THE WALRUS (1967)\nTHE BEATLES - BLUE JAY WAY (1967)\nTRAFFIC - HOLE IN MY SHOE (1967)\nTHE ROLLING STONES - WE LOVE YOU (1967)\nTHE ROLLING STONES - 2000 LIGHT YEARS FROM HOME (1967)\nPINK FLOYD - INTERSTELLAR OVERDRIVE (1967)\nTHE DOORS - THE CRYSTAL SHIP (1967)\nTRAFFIC - PAPER SUN (1967)\nERIC BURDON &amp; THE NEW ANIMALS - Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness) (1967)\nERIC BURDON &amp; THE NEW ANIMALS - San Franciscan Nights (1967)\nJANIS JOPLIN - BALL AND CHAIN (1967)\nSTATUS QUO - PICTURES OF MATCHSTICK MEN (1968)\nPINK FLOYD - SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN (1968)\nPINK FLOYD - CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE (1968)\nSTEVE MILLER BAND - Sittin' In Circles (1968)\nSTEVE MILLER BAND - Roll With It (1968)\nQUICKSILVER MESSENGER SERVICE - Dino's Song (1968) \nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE - Greasy Heart (1968)\nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE - Instrumental (1968)\nGREATFUL DEAD - New Potato Caboose (1968) \nJIMI HENDRIX - ARE YOU EXPERIENCED (Promo) \nJIMI HENDRIX - VOODOO CHILD (Psychedelic Promo)\nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE - CROWN OF CREATION (1968)\nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE - WE CAN BE TOGETHER (1969) - Altamont \nJEFFERSON AIRPLANE - THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS LIFE (1969) - Altamont \nTHE GRATEFUL DEAD - HARD TO HANDLE (1970)\nTHE GRATEFUL DEAD - CHINA CAT SUNFLOWER ( I Know You Rider) (1970)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1527f6085ab5c7b77f11e40bd4f3d82c234eb5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+359","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1527f6085ab5c7b77f11e40bd4f3d82c234eb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,39,246,8,90,181,199,183,127,17,228,11,212,243,216,44,35,78,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
