He treats her like she is his heart; like he needs her to exist; like he would do anything in his power to make her happy.\nLexi knows Landyn James loves her just as much as she loves him, if not more. Deep down, she also knows high school sweethearts arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expected to last, but their relationship is different. They are soul mates. Their connection is unbreakable.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong when you have love like that...?\nEverything.\nWhat will the future hold...?\nOnly time will tell.\n\nBook 2: Trish, Just Trish (This Can't Be Happening #1) by Lynda Leeanne (April 2013) \n\nPatricia Grace Kincaid is haunted by her past and no matter what she does, the ghosts wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay away.

She isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the same feisty, fearless bitch she used to beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or is she?\n\nWhat will happen when the person she screwed over storms back into her life? She freaks. Is it for the reason sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always hoped forÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ that Tony Lopez, the breathtakingly sexy Latino love of her life, has finally decided to forgive her? Hell no. Will he demand her complete submission? Yes. Will he make her life hell? Double yes. Will she, in return, torture him? Hell-to-the-yes. Will her past come back to haunt her? Absolutely.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a4e13a8e03937ed9d934c57b642224dc0d54de","amp;dn":"This+Can%27t+Be+Happening+Series+%281-2%29+by+Lynda+Leeanne+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a4e13a8e03937ed9d934c57b642224dc0d54de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,164,225,58,142,3,147,126,217,217,52,197,123,100,34,36,220,13,84,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
