It was released in 2003 and charted at No. 14 on The Billboard 200. It was like a &quot;trip down memory lane&quot; as Jon Bon Jovi likes to put it[citation needed]. It has acoustic versions of many of Bon Jovi's biggest hits. Many of the 80's hard hitting chart-rockers are presented in a different light as soulful ballads. This Left Feels Right has sold 549,727 copies in the US (July 2007).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5653c1bd466bdc8fee72d4e4400bbb9bfc31e6","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+This+Left+Feels+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5653c1bd466bdc8fee72d4e4400bbb9bfc31e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,86,83,193,189,70,107,220,143,238,114,212,228,64,11,187,155,252,49,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
