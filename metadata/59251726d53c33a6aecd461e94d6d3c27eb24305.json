This album contained the infamous underground hit &quot;Fuck Compton&quot; which disses the West Coast hip hop.\n\nThe intro used the same beat as N.W.A's &quot;efil4zaggin&quot; album intro. Tim taunted &quot;I stole your beat and made it better, to show the whole world that you ain't nothing but a bunch of pussies&quot; before a number of disparaging answering machine messages supported Tim's position. Tim rapped: &quot;Wearing all that black, driving them cars, but you still look wack!&quot;\nA skit called &quot;DJ Quik Beat Down&quot; was a forty second audio snippet of Tim Dog physically assaulting DJ Quik.\nThe track &quot;Step To Me&quot; taunted Compton rappers and included the line &quot;DJ Quik he can suck my dick&quot;.\n&quot;Michel'le Conversation&quot; was a skit where a Michel'le soundalike called Tim Dog to complain about Tim's Compton diss, but then ended up admitting she was &quot;tired of him (Dre) beating down on me&quot; and for Tim to &quot;Call me when you're in town&quot;.\nThe track &quot;Goin Wild in the Penile&quot; included an intro whereby Tim had recently been released from prison for shooting a &quot;Compton kid&quot;.\nThe lyrical insults were arguably the opening salvo in what would later become the East Coast versus West Coast hip hop conflict which would ultimately lead to the &quot;beef&quot; between Bad Boy Records and Death Row Records.\n\nBirth name\tTimothy Blair\nBorn\tJanuary 1, 1967\nOrigin\tThe Bronx, New York\nDied\tFebruary 14, 2013 (aged 46)\nGenres\tHip hop\nInstruments\tVocals\nYears active\t1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009\nLabels\tRuffhouse/ Columbia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59251726d53c33a6aecd461e94d6d3c27eb24305","amp;dn":"Tim+Dog-Penicillin+On+Wax+1991+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59251726d53c33a6aecd461e94d6d3c27eb24305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,37,23,38,213,60,51,166,174,205,70,30,148,214,211,194,126,178,67,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
