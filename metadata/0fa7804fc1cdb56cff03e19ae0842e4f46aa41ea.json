Everyone puts forth a great effort, with special praise heaped upon Neil Young for his incendiary &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, and Eric Clapton who brought down the house with &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright&quot; in what may be his single best performance of the 1990s.\n\nDVD-R2 sourced directly from the currently out-of-print laserdisc release. One can only hope for an official DVD release someday.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fa7804fc1cdb56cff03e19ae0842e4f46aa41ea","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+%26amp%3B+Friends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fa7804fc1cdb56cff03e19ae0842e4f46aa41ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,167,128,79,193,205,181,108,255,3,225,154,224,132,46,79,70,170,65,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
