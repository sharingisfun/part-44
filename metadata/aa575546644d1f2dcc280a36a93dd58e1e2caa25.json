The main objective of Packet Tracer is to serve as a support tool for the Cisco Academy. This tool is extremely useful for both students and teachers. Basically, Packet Tracer allows you to build a network with a range of simulated &quot;real-life&quot; equipment (Cisco equipment, of course), so different configuration options can be tested. You get a range of routers, switches, end-client systems and connections to build the simulated network. The operating systems of the routers and even some portions of PC's are also simulated.\n\no Supported Operating Systems:\no Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Server 2003, Server 2008 and Windows 7\n\no System Requirements\n* CPU: Intel Pentium II 500 MHz or better\n* RAM: 256mb or more\n* Storage: 300mb of free disk space\n* Resolution: 1024x768 (800x600 minimum)\n* Internet Connection (if using mulituser feature)\n* Flash Player 6.0 or Higher\n\no Installtion Instructions:\n* Run PacketTracer 5.2.exe\n* Thats it, no patch or crack required!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa575546644d1f2dcc280a36a93dd58e1e2caa25","amp;dn":"Cisco+Packet+Tracer+5.2+%5Bw%2Fextras+%26+documentation%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa575546644d1f2dcc280a36a93dd58e1e2caa25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,87,85,70,100,77,31,45,204,40,10,54,169,61,213,142,30,44,170,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
