David's first novel is set up like a classic disaster yarn: he follows several individuals and groups as they grapple with the approach, onslaught and aftermath of the cataclysmic &quot;time wave&quot;?a culmination of all those nuclear tests?that exchanges parcels of today's land, including much of Manhattan, with their prehistoric counterparts. That's a nifty premise, but David works it ragged. His human cast is too large?the U.S. president, scientists, tourists, bikers, gang members, a little old lady, a dysfunctional family out sailing, etc.?to inspire sympathy with anyone in particular. His dinos, with a couple of exceptions, are too hazily drawn to inspire the sort of fear or awe that Crichton's did in Jurassic Park. There's far-fetched science too, as a frantic White House comes up with a solution that could just lead to doomsday. Despite a few memorable moments (most notably, that little old lady domesticating a duckbill dino with bags of sugar) it's all too much, as overbearing as the ancient beasts themselves.\n\nThunder of Time\n\nTen years ago, the prehistoric past collided with the present as time itself underwent a tremendous disruption, transporting huge swaths of the Cretaceous Period into the world of the twentieth century. Entire neighborhoods and cities were replaced by dense primeval jungles and modern humanity suddenly found itself sharing the earth with fierce dinosaurs. In the end, desperate measures were taken to halt the disruptions and the crisis appeared to be over.\n\nUntil now.\n\nSlowly at first, but with increasing frequency, time begins to unravel once more. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse, Nick Paulson, Director of the newly-formed Office of Security Science, discovers that the time displacements are being manipulated by unknown parties, utilizing a mysterious new technology. Indeed, the very integrity of the space-time continuum appears to be at risk.\n\nTo preserve both the future and the past, Nick and his allies must uncover the secrets hidden within in a lost temple at the center of a dino-infested jungleÃ¢â‚¬â€œand in an enigmatic structure on the surface of the moon. But they are not alone in their quest. A cult of ruthless fanatics is also intent on controlling the time waves, and they will stop at nothing to reshape history to their own design . . . .\n\nDinosaur Thunder\n\nEighteen years ago, the prehistoric past collided with the present as time itself underwent a tremendous disruption, transporting huge swaths of the Cretaceous period into the twentieth century. Neighborhoods, towns, and cities were replaced by dense primeval jungles and modern humanity suddenly found itself sharing the world with fierce dinosaurs. In the end, desperate measures were taken to halt the disruptions and the crisis appeared to be over.\n\nUntil now.\n\nNew dinosaurs begin to appear, rampaging through cities. A secret mission to the Moon discovers a living Tyrannosaurus Rex trapped in an alternate timeline. As time begins to unravel once more, Nick Paulson, director of the Office of Security Science, finds a time passage to the Cretaceous period where humans, ripped from the comforts of the twenty-first century, are barely surviving in the past. Led by a cultlike religious leader, these survivors are at war with another sentient species descended from dinosaurs.\n\nAs the asteroid that ends the reign of dinosaurs rushes toward Earth, Nick and his allies must survive a war between species and save the future as we know it.\n\nDinosaur Thunder is a terrifying, futuristic thriller in the tradition of Michael Crichton and Douglas Preston","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1540986b724b23128d9fee5c9fc00ec2c26d39bd","amp;dn":"Thunder+Trilogy+-+James+F.+David","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1540986b724b23128d9fee5c9fc00ec2c26d39bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,64,152,107,114,75,35,18,141,159,238,92,159,192,14,194,194,109,57,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
