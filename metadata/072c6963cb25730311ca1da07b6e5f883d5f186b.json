They aired on Cartoon Network as a series of shorts after the theatrical release of Episode II, but before Episode III. Then they were released to dvd, linking all the shorts back to back as movies, in these two volumes.\n\nThese Cartoons are in no way connected with the subsequent Clone Wars computer animated movie or the series of the same name which also aired on CN. However those projects did borrow heavily from this series' character designs.\n\nThese Movies are PS3 ready, in mp4 format, with commentary tracks included. Volume 1 has hardcoded subs for the few blurbs of alien dialect in Chapter 6. and the dvd extras are also included.\n\nThis Torrent Includes:\n\nMovies:\n\nClone Wars vol. 1.mp4 + 2 commentary tracks\nClone Wars vol. 2.mp4 + commentary\n\nExtras:\n\nCWv1 Bridging the Saga.avi\nCWv1 Featurette.avi\nCWv2 Connecting the Dots.avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072c6963cb25730311ca1da07b6e5f883d5f186b","amp;dn":"%7Chms-one%7C+Clone+Wars+vol.+1+%26+2+%2B+extras%2C+Genndy+Tartakovsky+%28dv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072c6963cb25730311ca1da07b6e5f883d5f186b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,44,105,99,203,37,115,3,17,202,29,160,123,110,95,136,61,95,24,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
