Anjini, married but childless and an incorrigible flirt; Binodini, very worried about her children's hissa in the family property; Chandralekha, who eloped with a foreigner on the eve of her wedding; Eshwari, who is just a little too popular at Modern School Barakhamba Road; and the Judge's favourite (though fathers shouldn't have favourites): the quietly fiery Debjani, champion of all the stray animals on Hailey Road, who reads the English news on DD and clashes constantly with investigative journalist Dylan Singh Shekhawat, he of shining professional credentials but tarnished personal reputation, crushingly dismissive of her employer's 'state sponsored propaganda' but always seeking her out with half-sarcastic, half-intrigued dark eyes.\n\nLanguage \t  English\nPublisher \t  HarperCollins Publishers India\nISBN \t          9789350299685\nPublication Date  2013-02-18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d869d0aca319b3ff189f7cd5052912d12e1c5ccb","amp;dn":"Those+Pricey+Thakur+Girls+by+Anuja+Chauhan+%2AIndian+Novel%2A+-+Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d869d0aca319b3ff189f7cd5052912d12e1c5ccb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,105,208,172,163,25,179,255,24,159,124,213,5,41,18,209,46,28,92,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
