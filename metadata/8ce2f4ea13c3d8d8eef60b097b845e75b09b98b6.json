Like numerous Southern California groups in the mid-'60s, the Hondells, despite numerous picture sleeves, were not a bonafide group. Their recordings were put together by floating lineups of Los Angeles session men, overseen by producer Gary Usher. &quot;Little Honda&quot; itself featured ace guitarists Glen Campbell and Richie Podolor, as well as drummer Hal Blaine. Hondells groups were put together for live performance in the wake of &quot;Little Honda,&quot; but session musicians such as Podolor were always present on the recordings.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hondells-p25236/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-hondells-p25236/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nThe Hondells may be a marginal group, but if you're going to take the plunge for an entire album's worth of material, it would be hard to imagine a better value than this compilation. A whopping 36 songs are crammed into one disc of 1964-66 recordings, including everything from their first two albums and early singles. It's somewhat samey-sounding, but still a half-decent facsimile of the Jan &amp; Dean/Beach Boys sound circa 1964. Three hot, brooding surf instrumentals penned by Richie Podolor sound out of place, yet at the same time are about the best tracks here besides &quot;Little Honda.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-complete-motorcycle-collection-r341431&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-complete-motorcycle-collection-r341431&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
