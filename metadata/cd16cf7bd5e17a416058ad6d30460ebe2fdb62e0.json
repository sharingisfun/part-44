Although that statement is debatable, the MJQ certainly sounds in prime form throughout the easily recommended release.\n\n* RECORDED LIVE IN LJUBLANA, SLOVENIA, MAY 27, 1960.-\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - The Little Comedy; La Cantatrice; Harlequin; Fontessa\n02 - 'Round Midnight\n03 - Cylinder\n04 - Bag's Groove\n05 - Odds Against Tomorrow\n06 - It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\n07 - A Social Call\n\nCD2\n01 - Django\n02 - I Should Care\n03 - How High The Moon\n04 - Colombine - Pulcinella\n05 - Spanish Steps\n06 - Pyramid (Blues For Junior)\n07 - Milt Meets Sid\n08 - I Remember Clifford\n09 - Vendome\n10 - Skating In Central Park\n\n\n*1995 Atlantic / WEA | 82763-2\n\n\nPersonnel:\nMilt Jackson - vibraphone\nJohn Lewis - piano\nPercy Heath - bass\nConnie Kay - drums\n\n\n\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet - Third Stream Music (1960) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11207533/The_Modern_Jazz_Quartet_-_Third_Stream_Music_%281960%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11207533/The_Modern_Jazz_Quartet_-_Third_Stream_Music_%281960%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet - At Music Inn (1956) [EAC-FLAC]:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9714234/The_Modern_Jazz_Quartet_-_At_Music_Inn_(1956)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9714234/The_Modern_Jazz_Quartet_-_At_Music_Inn_(1956)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet - At Music Inn.
