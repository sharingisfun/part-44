Citing influences such as Broken Social Scene, Pavement, Neutral Milk Hotel, Olivia Tremor Control, Belle &amp; Sebastian, and Sufjan Stevens, the band is comprised of Simon Balthazer (vocals), Mark West (guitar), Leon Beckenham (trumpet), Cathy Lucas (violin), Justin Finch (bass), and Amos Memon (drums). They released their first single, Talking Backwards, in 2006 on Fortuna Pop. It was followed by You Are One of the Few Outsiders Who Really Understands Us/In the Trunk (2007, Fandango), Fire Escape/We Live by the Lake (2007, White Heat Records), and Harold T. Wilkins (2008, Felt Tip Records). The band released its debut album, Reservoir, in 2009. In 2012, Fanfarlo returned with its more synth and new wave-inspired sophomore effort, Rooms Filled with Light.\n\nRooms Filled With Light (2012) Album Information:\nAudio CD (February 28, 2012)\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLabel: Atlantic\n\n1.
