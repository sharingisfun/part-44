The best single of Dissident is actually the three-part series released in the U.K. and called the Dissident/Live in Atlanta CDs. With this three-disc set, Pearl Jam had released live versions of almost their entire first two albums. All that was missing was &quot;Leash&quot; from Vs. and &quot;Oceans&quot; from Ten.\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Dissident\n[02] Release [Live]\n[03] Rearviewmirror [Live]\n[04] Even Flow [Live]\n[05] Dissident [Live]\n[06] Why Go [Live]\n[07] Deep [Live]\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 00h:31m:13s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Jeremy [Live]\n[02] Glorified G [Live]\n[03] Daughter [Live]\n[04] Go [Live]\n[05] Animal [Live]\n[06] Garden [Live]\n[07] State Of Love And Trust [Live]\n[08] Black [Live]\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:36m:13s\n\nCD-03 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Alive (Live)\n[02] Blood (Live)\n[03] W.M.A (Live)\n[04] Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town (Live)\n[05] Rats (Live)\n[06] Once (Live)\n[07] Porch (Live)\n[08] Indifference (Live)\n\nCD-03 Play Time - 00h:42m:55s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:50m:21s\nTotal File Size....................... 259mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
