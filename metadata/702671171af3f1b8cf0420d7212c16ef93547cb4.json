Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food. Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Jerry O'Connell, and Adam Scott star in the Dimension Films production.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702671171af3f1b8cf0420d7212c16ef93547cb4","amp;dn":"Piranha%282010%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702671171af3f1b8cf0420d7212c16ef93547cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,38,113,23,26,243,241,184,207,4,32,215,33,44,22,239,147,84,124,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
