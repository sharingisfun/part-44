The series features a group of shrewd and savvy dealers who attend a weekly, misguided freight auction in pursuit of lost items to flip for profit. These guys are the real deal and the money they make from a dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work will leave viewers astounded.\n\n Lou takes a huge risk on a high-end luxury watch that the other dealers say smells like a fake. John uncovers a kinky pirateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasure. And, Robbie and Kathleen hope theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve pulled a rabbit out of the hat by betting on a mystery magicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s box.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:491d0faef0ca3f7d5cb07115d5b1703618cf7df0","amp;dn":"Lost.and.Sold.Canada.S01E01.HDTV.CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"491d0faef0ca3f7d5cb07115d5b1703618cf7df0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,29,15,174,240,202,63,125,92,176,113,21,213,177,112,54,24,207,125,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
