There are entries on all the most important individual artists, from Blake to Warhol, from Oldenburg to Rauschenberg; entries on movements, from Anti-Pop to Zebra; entries on cities and countries, from Paris to Japan; and entries on genres, from Assemblage to Ready-mades. There's even an entry on Pop Art's chief obsession, Marilyn Monroe. Most entries are accompanied by illustrations, over seventy of them in full colour. Some are so w^ell-known they have become their ow^n myths, while others are still sufficiently unfamiliar to provoke considerable controversy.
