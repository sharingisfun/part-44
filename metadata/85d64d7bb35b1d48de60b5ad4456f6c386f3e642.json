Kidnapped as a young boy and sold into slavery by a power-hungry mobster, he has thought of nothing but vengeance. For 12 years he has immersed himself in the world of pleasure slaves searching for the one man he holds ultimately responsible. Finally, the architect of his suffering has emerged with a new identity, but not a new nature. If Caleb is to get close enough to strike, he must become the very thing he abhors and kidnap a beautiful girl to train her to be all that he once was.\n\nEighteen-year-old Olivia Ruiz has just woken up in a strange place. Blindfolded and bound, there is only a calm male voice to welcome her. His name is Caleb, though he demands to be called Master. Olivia is young, beautiful, naÃƒÂ¯ve and willful to a fault. She has a dark sensuality that cannot be hidden or denied, though she tries to accomplish both. Although she is frightened by the strong, sadistic, and arrogant man who holds her prisoner, what keeps Olivia awake in the dark is her unwelcome attraction to him.\n\nWARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious consent, strong language, and graphic violence.\n\n\nSeduced in the Dark: Dark Duet, Book 2\n13 hrs and 36 mins\n\nThe exciting, titillating, and action-filled conclusion to Captive in the Dark.\n\nWhat is the price of redemption?\n\nRescued from sexual slavery by a mysterious Pakistani officer, Caleb carries the weight of a debt that must be paid in blood.\n\nThe road has been long and fraught with uncertainty, but for Caleb and Livvie, it's all coming to an end.\n\nCan he surrender the woman he loves for the sake of vengeance?\n\nOr will he make the ultimate sacrifice?\n\n\nEpilogue: The Dark Duet: Book 3\n5 hrs and 35 mins \n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m writing this because you begged. You know how I love the begging. In fact, you probably know too many things and know them far too well. Who am I? Well, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m trying to figure out. I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves. She loves me. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite sick, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it? Of course, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more to our story than can be surmised in a few short sentences, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m at a loss for justifying my behavior back then. I assume if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading this, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to make those justifications. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve already made your own. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reading this because you want to know about the rest of the story. You want to know what happened that warm summer night in September of 2010, the night I met Livvie at The Paseo. It was the night my life changed all over again. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen exactly as Livvie said. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been very kind to me in the retelling of our story. The truth is far moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦complicated. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d64d7bb35b1d48de60b5ad4456f6c386f3e642","amp;dn":"CJ+Roberts+-+Dark+Duets+Series+Books+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d64d7bb35b1d48de60b5ad4456f6c386f3e642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,214,77,123,179,91,29,72,222,96,181,173,68,86,246,195,134,243,230,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
