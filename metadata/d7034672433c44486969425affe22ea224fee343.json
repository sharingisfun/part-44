First observed by US bomber pilots in the Second World War, &quot;the jet&quot; is the engine of the atmosphere: it makes flights from America to Europe quicker (if pilots latch onto it, they can get a 200mph tailwind), but it also cranks up our weather events - last year&amp;#039;s floods were partly caused by &quot;an extremely sluggish jet&quot;. Now meteorologists believe it&amp;#039;s shifting in ways that could have a dramatic impact on the UK; exactly how, no-one&amp;#039;s quite sure (they need bigger computers), but it&amp;#039;ll probably mean more floods.\n\n\nThanks to Adam Cook - MGV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7034672433c44486969425affe22ea224fee343","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Jet.Stream.and.Us.2008.DVBC.XviD.MP3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7034672433c44486969425affe22ea224fee343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,3,70,114,67,60,68,72,105,105,66,90,255,226,46,162,36,254,227,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
