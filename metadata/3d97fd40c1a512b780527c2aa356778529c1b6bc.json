It allows you to select which partitions to trim (you should leave defaults unless you know what you are doing) and run the process easily. Scheduled auto-trim is also available.\nPlease note that fstrim output depends on kernel and device. It works fine unless you see errors. You might see big amounts of bytes, zero amount or repeating amount. All are fine! Read fstrim manual to understand why all these outputs are valid.\n\nTHIS APP REQUIRES ROOT\n\nWarning! This app should only be used by ADVANCED users! If you do not understand what it does - DO NOT USE IT! You can find fstrim() man in Google and more information on XDA - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2104326. RTFM before asking any questions or rating this app bad!\nSome Android users suffer from poor performance after some days/weeks of heavy usage. This is due to a well-known TRIM bug affecting these devices (users report Nexus devices, Samsung Galaxy S3 and HTC One X devices are affected). Kernels with -discard mount option are NOT affected!\nThe source of the problem is that internal storage is not properly TRIMmed when needed. You can find lots of information on XDA - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1971852 and http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1929021 It is also well-known fact that running fstrim Linux tool from time to time fixes the issue until internal memory runs out of free blocks. Other solutions like mounting with -discard or disabling fsync may be slow or dangerous.\n\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:-\n\nRequires Android-2.1 and up\n\nDOWNLOAD THE APP\n\nINSTALL &amp; DONE.\n\n\nTorrent is working checked on MMX CANVAS-2\n\nSpecial Thanks To Admin And Other Member of {AMRG} RELEASERS GROUP\n\nPlease Seed After Download...!!\n\n\nPlease comment ! Thanks !\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d97fd40c1a512b780527c2aa356778529c1b6bc","amp;dn":"LagFix+%28fstrim%29+Premium+v1.5.1+by+CSK070","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d97fd40c1a512b780527c2aa356778529c1b6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,151,253,64,193,165,18,183,128,82,124,42,163,86,119,133,41,193,182,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
