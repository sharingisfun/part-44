Volume I was published in 1776, and went through six printings (a remarkable feat for its time). Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, VI in 1788-89. The original volumes were published as quartos, a common publishing practice of the time.The books cover the period of the Roman Empire after Marcus Aurelius, from just before 180 to 1453 and beyond, concluding in 1590. They take as their material the behavior and decisions that led to the decay and eventual fall of the Roman Empire in the East and West, offering an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.Gibbon is sometimes called the first ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmodern historian of ancient Rome.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ By virtue of its mostly objective approach and highly accurate use of reference material, GibbonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s work was adopted as a model for the methodologies of 19th and 20th century historians. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcb3b719583abc54f8cb337b3050e037a8d315d","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Decline+and+Fall+of+the+Roman+Empire+by+E.+Gibbon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcb3b719583abc54f8cb337b3050e037a8d315d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,203,59,113,149,131,171,197,79,140,179,55,179,5,14,3,122,141,49,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
