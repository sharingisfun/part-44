Edgar Hoover\n\nNow that NDCC is available, I no longer need to answer &quot;no&quot; to the question which is often put to me, namely: &quot;Mr. Dodd, is there a book which I can read so I can know what you know?&quot; No higher praise is possible for this book.\nNorman Dodd Ã¢â‚¬â€ Chief Investigator Reece Committee to Investigate Foundations\n\nThis book concerns the way in which our nation and other nations are actually governed. As Benjamin Disaeli said, this is not the way in which most people think nations are governed. The whole subject of the Insiders who so largely control our political and economic lives is a fascinating mystery.\nFor the reader who is intelligent but uninitiated in the literature of superpolitics, I can think of no better introduction to the field than NDCC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c0c12a0b23fc30c9e93a126806244c4f760b1dc","amp;dn":"None.Dare.Call.It.Conspiracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c0c12a0b23fc30c9e93a126806244c4f760b1dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,12,18,160,178,63,195,12,158,147,161,38,128,98,68,196,247,96,177,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
