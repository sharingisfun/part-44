It does a fairly good job in providing a brief history, but the main strength of the collection simply comes from the music.  Featuring cuts from Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf, B. B.  King, Slim Harpo, Junior Parker, Elmore James, Albert Collins, and many, many others, it's a quick and effective way to sample a variety of different blues styles.  For neophytes, Essential Blues does offer a splendid introduction to the genre. \n\nThe House of Blues label has done it again with another incredible collection of blues essentials.  From classics must-haves by Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and John Lee Hooker to more recent recordings by Taj Mahal and Luther Allison, this collection is calling to you.\nAlso have to mention that the album art and liner notes are beautifully designed and well-written.\n\nOnly reason not to give it a full five stars is too many tracks pulled from other HOB discs, but if you don't have them all yet, you won't mind. ~ A Customer, Amazon \n\nVA House of Blues: Essential Blues V3 Dsk 2 of 2\n01  Toehold - Robert Ward\n02  Voodoo Daddy - Lonnie Brooks\n03  We're Gonna Make It - Little Milton\n04  Change Of Heart, Change Of Mind - Robert Cray\n05  Keep Your Hands Out Of My Pocket - Otis Spann\n06  Screamin' And Hollerin' Blues - Allen Youngblood Hart\n07  You've Got Me Dizzy - Jimmy Reed\n08  I Don't Know - Ruth Brown\n09  Katie Mae - Lightnin' Hopkins\n10  Best Of Life - Maria Muldaur/Dr. John\n11  Driving Wheel - Robert Lockwood Jr.\n12  Go To The Mardi Gras - Professor Longhair\n13  Honky Tonk Woman - Taj Mahal\n14  C-Jam Blues - Clarence 'Gatemouth' Brown\n15  Fool's Paradise - Charles Brown\n16  Meet Me In The City - Junior Kimbrough","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce2bec4fc5e83edfe5c1e4ad74ec5ec54089aa9","amp;dn":"VA+House+of+Blues%3A+Essential+Blues+V3+Dsk+2+of+2+%281999%29+%5BBlues%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce2bec4fc5e83edfe5c1e4ad74ec5ec54089aa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,226,190,196,252,94,131,237,254,92,30,74,215,78,197,236,84,8,154,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
