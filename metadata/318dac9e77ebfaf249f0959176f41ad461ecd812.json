The story of the pious and steadfast Tobit (Tobias the elder) is taken from the apocryphal Book of Tobias, in which he is persecuted for burying the dead. Patient in adversity, Tobit is finally restored to health and prosperity, while his son, Tobias, is safely married to Sarah.\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\nIn this performance from Joachim Carlos Martini and the Frankfurt Baroque Orchestra, Martini has made some adjustments to the score; adding a number of sinfonias to delineate scenes plus some extra arias. The result is attractive without ever being dramatically gripping...Martini has assembled an excellent polyglot cast who all acquit themselves well....The Junge Kantorei address the choruses with lively enthusiasm...The Frankfurt Baroque Orchestra accompany nicely and give neat accounts of the overture from Tamerlano and the various sinfonias included in the work. If you think of this as a recital disc then it is a nice proposition. Just put it on and enjoy some of HandelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest music in attractive performances.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:318dac9e77ebfaf249f0959176f41ad461ecd812","amp;dn":"Handel+-+Tobit+%28Oratorio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"318dac9e77ebfaf249f0959176f41ad461ecd812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,141,172,158,119,235,250,242,73,240,149,145,118,244,26,212,97,236,216,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
