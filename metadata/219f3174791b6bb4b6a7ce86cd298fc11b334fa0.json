American Nightmare will shine a new light on the world of Wake while appealing to fans and newcomers alike. \n\nThe single player campaign comes from the darkest corners of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœNight SpringsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a Twilight Zone inspired fiction. American Nightmare is an exaggerated and gritty rendering of that world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where the horrors of reality have the all too easy habit of coming true. When Wake becomes stuck in the alternate shadowed world of Night Springs, he must hunt down his evil double, Mr. Scratch, to find answers. A supernatural serial killer, Scratch is fixated on WakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Alice, and even more horribly, WakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise. To survive and thrive in the darkest of nights, Wake must learn to control reality itself and unravel the secrets of Night Springs with a trusty flashlight by his side and whatever weapon he can find. \n\nThe brand new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fight till DawnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ arcade mode places Wake in the battle of his life. Players are tasked with surviving a full night of brutal onslaughts while racking up their score. With a myriad of new enemies to battle, Wake wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any trouble since heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have plenty of deadly options within his arsenal: old stalwarts like the flare gun, wild new favorites like the nail gun and old school Remedy favorites like the Uzi. Thankfully, safe havens and unlockable weapons litter the landscape, allowing for a momentary respite from the darkness. Surviving until dawn is only the beginning though, as online leaderboards pit friends head-to-head to see who the real champion of light is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:219f3174791b6bb4b6a7ce86cd298fc11b334fa0","amp;dn":"%5Bgog%5D+Alan+Wake%27s+American+Nightmare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"219f3174791b6bb4b6a7ce86cd298fc11b334fa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,159,49,116,121,27,107,180,182,167,206,134,205,41,143,193,27,51,79,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
