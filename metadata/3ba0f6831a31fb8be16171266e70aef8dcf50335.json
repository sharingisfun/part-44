He was our first true celebrity, one of the most photographed faces of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThis course explores Twain's dual identities as one of our classic authors and as an almost mythical presence in our nation's cultural life. It seeks to appreciate Twain's literary achievements and to understand his life by highlighting seven of his major works:\n\nInnocents Abroad\nRoughing It\nOld Times on the Mississippi\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\nThe Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson.\nProfessor Stephen Railton is extraordinarily qualified to bring to light the subtlest insights into Twain's texts. An expert on Twain, he has appeared on The Newshour with Jim Lehrer as a distinguished Twain scholar and is the creator of Mark Twain in His Times, an award-winning Internet archive about Twain's life and career. Professor Railton shows the issues that concerned Twain most throughout his lifetime and that appear repeatedly in the pages of his books.\n\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n24 Lectures \n\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n\n1.\tNeeding No Introduction?\n2.\tFrom Samuel Clemens to Mark Twain\n3.\tThe Sense of Mark Twain's Humor\n4.\tMarketing Twain\n5.\tInnocents Abroad, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Going East\n6.\tInnocents Abroad, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€Traveling to Unlearn\n7.\tRoughing ItÃ¢â‚¬â€Going West\n8.\tThe Lecture Tours\n9.\tThe Whittier After-Dinner Speech\n10.\t&quot;Old Times on the Mississippi&quot;\n11.\tThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n12.\tThe Performances of Tom Sawyer\n13.\tHuck Finn, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Defining an American Voice\n14.\tHuck Finn, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Quest for Freedom\n15.\tHuck Finn, IIIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Great American Novel?\n16.\tHuck Finn, IVÃ¢â‚¬â€Classrooms and Controversy\n17.\tConnecticut Yankee, IÃ¢â‚¬â€Unwriting the Middle Ages\n18.\tConnecticut Yankee, IIÃ¢â‚¬â€Revisiting the Nineteenth Century\n19.\tConnecticut Yankee, IIIÃ¢â‚¬â€The Quest for Status\n20.\tPudd'nhead WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â€Fictions of Law and Custom\n21.\tAnti-Imperialist Works\n22.\tLate Twain in Public\n23.\tLate Twain in Private\n24.\tSam Clemens is Dead/Long Live Mark Twain\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2567&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2567&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba0f6831a31fb8be16171266e70aef8dcf50335","amp;dn":"Life+and+Work+of+Mark+Twain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba0f6831a31fb8be16171266e70aef8dcf50335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,160,246,131,26,49,251,139,225,97,113,38,110,112,174,248,220,245,3,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
