And by Ã¢â‚¬Å“changingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ I mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“eliminating.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The world the rightwing envisions will have the old white aristocracy still running things no matter how much they are outnumbered by non-whites. I think the technical term for that is Ã¢â‚¬Å“South Africa, 1982.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Justices are looking for excuses to strike down the Voting Rights ActÃ¢â‚¬â€besides the fact that it guarantees voting rights. They canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say that reason out loud, although Antonin Scalia comes pretty close.\n\nThe sequester kicks in at the end of today. I guess that makes today Sequester Eve. On Sequester Eve, families will sit around the dinner table. The eldest child will ask the ritual question Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why is this night different from all other nights.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And the parents will answer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because this is the last meal weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have where we can be sure that the meat was inspected.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sequester Eve is the night that Santa Boehner gets into his sleigh and flies over every home in America, crapping on all of them. There are 8 days of Hanukkah, 7 days of Kwanza, and 12 days of ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬â€but there are unlimited days of Sequester! This can go on for as long as Republicans can drag it out.\n\nJohn Boehner has halted talks on avoiding the sequester. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no sense in talking to him. You might as well be talking to a block of wood. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what it looks like when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking to BoehnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lacquered head anyway. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hear anything about raising new revenue. So please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play any tape of him earlier, talking about raising new revenue.\n\nOn Sean HannityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show last night, Bob Woodward said the White House email that had put him into such a tizzy was code for Ã¢â‚¬Å“you better watch out.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bob, when you look for threats to the public in policy decisions, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being a journalist. When you look for threats in everyday speech, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re being paranoid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4b162af072c1fd540de340c25e8e980d8b955b","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+March+01+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4b162af072c1fd540de340c25e8e980d8b955b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,75,22,42,240,114,193,253,84,13,227,64,194,94,142,152,13,139,149,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
