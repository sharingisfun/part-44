Mays\nPublisher: Springer, 2010\nISBN: 9048186315, 275 pages, PDF\n\n\n\nThere is no more fundamental resource than water. The basis of all life, water is fast becoming a key\nissue in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world, as well as a source of conflict. This fascinating book, which sets out many of\nthe ingenious methods by which ancient societies gathered, transported and stored water, is a timely\npublication as overextraction and profligacy threaten the existence of aquifers and watercourses that\nhave supplied our needs for millennia.\n\nIt provides an overview of the water technologies developed by a number of ancient civilizations, from\nthose of Mesopotamia and the Indus valley to later societies such as the Mycenaeans, Minoans, Persians,\nand the ancient Egyptians. Of course, no book on ancient water technologies would be complete without\ndiscussing the engineering feats of the Romans and Greeks, yet as well as covering these key\ncivilizations, it also examines how ancient American societies from the Hohokams to the Mayans and Incas\nhusbanded their water supplies. This unusually wide-ranging text could offer todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parched world some\nsolutions to the impending crisis in our water supply.\n\n&quot;This book provides valuable insights into the water technologies developed in ancient civilizations\nwhich are the underpinning of modern achievements in water engineering and management practices. It is\nthe best proof that &quot;the past is the key for the future.&quot; Andreas N. Angelakis, Hellenic Water Supply\nand Sewerage Systems Association, Greece\n\n\n&quot;This book makes a fundamental contribution to what will become the most important challenge of our\ncivilization facing the global crisis: the problem of water. Ancient Water Technologies provides a\ncomplete panorama of how ancient societies confronted themselves with the management of water. The role\nof this volume is to provide, for the first time on this issue, an extensive historical and scientific\nreconstruction and an indication of how traditional knowledge may be employed to ensure a sustainable\nfuture for all.&quot; Pietro Laureano, UNESCO expert for ecosystems at risk, Director of IPOGEA-Institute of\nTraditional Knowledge, Italy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccee1bbbc6523a5f5977e48eb2092c62dd46c69b","amp;dn":"Ancient+Water+Technologies%7EDiBYA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccee1bbbc6523a5f5977e48eb2092c62dd46c69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,238,27,187,198,82,58,95,89,119,228,142,178,9,44,98,221,70,198,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
