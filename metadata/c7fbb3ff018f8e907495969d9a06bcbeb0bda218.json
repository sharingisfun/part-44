Where side one fades out and side two fades back in they have been joined (with a short crossfade) so they are each a continuous 1.5 hours. No processing (EQ, compression etc.) was applied at any stage.\n\nUse is pretty much explained on the tapes - start with tape one and when you are comfortable, move on to tape 2, etc.\n\nIt should be noted that Tape 1 is designed to wake you up at the end, to train you to recognise when you are dreaming. Tapes 2, 3 and 4 do not wake you up at the end.\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7fbb3ff018f8e907495969d9a06bcbeb0bda218","amp;dn":"Hemi-Sync+Lucid+Dreaming+Series+Complete+Tapes+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7fbb3ff018f8e907495969d9a06bcbeb0bda218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,251,179,255,1,143,142,144,116,149,150,157,154,6,188,190,176,189,162,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
