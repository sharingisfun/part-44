It followed Foxtrot and was the band's commercial peak at that time, reaching #3 in the UK[1] where it remained on the charts for 21 weeks. The album went gold in the US in 1990. It was also a major breakthrough in terms of critical reception, and is considered one of the greatest albums of the progressive rock genre.\nThe album cover is a painting by Betty Swanwick called The Dream. The original painting did not feature a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song &quot;I Know What I Like.&quot;\nA digitally remastered version was released on CD in 1994 on Virgin in Europe and on Atlantic Records in the US and Canada. The remastered booklet features the lyrics and credits which were missing on the original CD, while they had been on the inner sleeve of the LP album.\nA SACD/DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and stereo mixes) was released in the UK on 11 November 2008, including extensive interviews with the band and footage from concerts performed during 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ74.\n\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Progressive rock\nQuality: FLAC/tracks (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n1.
