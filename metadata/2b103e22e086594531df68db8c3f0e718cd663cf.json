When a thick fog descends upon a rural community and claims the lives of anyone unfortunate enough to be caught outside, a small band of survivors seeks refuge in a local grocery store. Now trapped in a darkened cloud of pure horror, the frightened denizens of the town are forced to fend off an advancing horde of murderous monsters. Punisher star Thomas Jane heads up an ensemble cast that includes Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, and Marcia Gay Harden.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 6 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 608\n\nFrame Height: 336\n\nFrame Rate: 23fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 110kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b103e22e086594531df68db8c3f0e718cd663cf","amp;dn":"Stephen+King%5C%27s+The+Mist%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b103e22e086594531df68db8c3f0e718cd663cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,16,62,34,224,134,89,69,49,223,104,219,140,63,14,113,140,214,99,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
