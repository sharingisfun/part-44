In 2012 we shared 55 bundles accounting for an impressive 1461 releases.  I don't know if we'll ever surpass our 2012 totals, but we're now up to 40 bundles for 2013 which accounts for 1094 releases.\n\nThat said, it was recently suggested to me that when I identify the different genres, it helps.  Although I've done this from time to time in the past, I usually shy away from doing it because an Artist can fit into several genres, and unless it's painfully obvious to me which genre they are, I will probably mess up more often than I get it right.\n\nBut, for what it's worth today.  This is how I would identify today's bundle.  If you want some Hip-Hip/Rap, be sure to check out Aaquil, D-Tropp, Limitless, Tay Collier, True Story, or Ty The Berean.  If you want some Alternative, then you have Anberlin, or House Of Heroes to choose from.  If you want some Electronica then be sure to grab both Andromeda Coast releases.  How about some Singer-Songwriter today?  Then grab the Brad Bramer releases or the Meredith Duke single.  Darrel Evans finally released a new Rock product.  And the ever popular Deitrick Haddon has a new R&amp;B release out.  If you want some music for your kids, don't forget to get a copy of Freedom Kids.  There's a lot of Contemporary music here today including Jon Bauer, Matt Redman, Meredith Andrews, and Phil Wickham.  Are you looking for some Praise &amp; Worship?  Then how about Living Miracles Studio, Meditation Of My Heart, or The Sonflowerz new single?  Interested in Pop?  Then Sarah Hart.  Maybe some Metal?  Then check out Trouble.  How about Folk music today?  I've got that covered too with The Twin Leaves' new release.\n\nBundle 40 includes the following 32 releases...\n\n * Aaquil - 2013 - The Ascension - Re-Released\n * Anberlin - 2013 - City Electric - Single\n * Andromeda Coast - 2013 - Across Kalon Skies\n * Andromeda Coast - 2013 - Celestrial EP\n * Brad Bramer - 2013 - God Is With Us - Single\n * Brad Bramer - 2013 - How He Loves - Single\n * Brad Bramer - 2013 - Morning Prayers\n * Brad Bramer - 2013 - Process EP\n * Brad Bramer - 2013 - The Avenue\n * D-Tropp - 2013 - Love's Runaways - Single\n * Darrell Evans - 2013 - Awesome God Is He\n * Deitrick Haddon - 2013 - Restoring Everything Damaged - Deluxe Edition\n * Freedom Kids - 2013 - Freedom Kids\n * House Of Heroes - 2013 - The Knock Down Drag Outs\n * Jon Bauer - 2013 - Roots Of Worship\n * Limitless - 2013 - No Limits\n * Living Miracles Studio - 2013 - Holiness\n * Living Miracles Studio - 2013 - Strawberry Fields Forever Music Festival\n * Matt Redman - 2013 - Sing And Shout - Single\n * Matt Redman - 2013 - Your Grace Finds Me\n * Meditation Of My Heart - 2013 - Psalms, Vol 1\n * Meredith Andrews - 2013 - Behold The Savior EP\n * Meredith Duke - 2013 - The Lord Will Fight For You - Single\n * Phil Wickham - 2013 - The Ascension\n * Sarah Hart - 2013 - Above Earth's Lamentation\n * Sonflowerz, The - 2013 - Little Lies - Single\n * Tay Collier - 2013 - Heart2Heart\n * Trouble - 2013 - The Distortion Field\n * True Story - 2013 - Building Blocks 2\n * Twin Leaves, The - 2013 - Songs For The Restless Souls\n * Ty The Berean - 2013 - Reborn 2 Remix, Vol 2\n * Ty The Berean - 2013 - The Wake Up EP\n\nBe Blessed,\nTorrentTracts - September 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226ce05785e715a96dea7efeeba6294fc7ba3247","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+40%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226ce05785e715a96dea7efeeba6294fc7ba3247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,108,224,87,133,231,21,169,109,234,126,254,235,166,41,79,199,186,50,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
