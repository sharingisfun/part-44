Suspicious, Joe \ntells Barry that he and his friends at \nS.T.A.R. Labs should look into the army's \ninvolvement. Wells informs the team that \nEiling was experimenting on his men to turn \nthem into super soldiers. Cisco confirms one \nof Eiling's soldiers, Bette Sans Souci, was at \nthe bomb site. The Flash tracks her down and \nrealizes that she's not setting off the bombs, \nshe is a meta-human who can blow things up \njust by touching them. Meanwhile, when Joe \nlearns Iris is writing about &quot;the streak,&quot; he \ntells Barry to make her stop. Barry realizes \nIris won't listen to him so he decides to have \nThe Flash pay her a visit. \n\n18/Slower\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f455c79f93aa279a386e7639c6db503f5fceffb1","amp;dn":"The.Flash.2014.S01E05.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f455c79f93aa279a386e7639c6db503f5fceffb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,85,199,159,147,170,39,154,56,110,118,57,198,219,80,63,95,206,255,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
