Specifically, rheology is concerned with the interrelation between time, force and deformation. Rheology originated from the Greek word Rheos which means to flow. The study includes a broad range of materials and industry processes. The important concepts in rheology include shear stress, viscosity, strain and elasticity.\n\nThis document was initially written as lectures material for the Rheology course taken by M.Sc students in Marseille University (Fall 2011). The course is complemented by laboratory experiments and if you are interested you will find them online easily (TPB does not allow posting websites, sorry). \n\nBasics of Rheology are explained using the minimum possible level of maths. Complicated models are avoided but the text aims to the understanding of the Physics behind the most common rheological tests. Some notions of Food and Polymers Rheology are also introduced.  \n\n\n2 files:\n\nOriginal text - Open Office Writer format\n\nPrintout - PDF format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaedd0706dcee0ed405b51ecf3a18afb2cdf7d86","amp;dn":"A+basic+introduction+to+Rheology+for+Polymers+Science+students","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaedd0706dcee0ed405b51ecf3a18afb2cdf7d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,237,208,112,109,206,224,237,64,91,81,236,243,161,138,251,44,223,125,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
