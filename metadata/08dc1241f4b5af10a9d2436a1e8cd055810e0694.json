Nikita was eventually \nbetrayed by the only people she thought she \ncould trust. Now, after three years in hiding, \nNikita is seeking retribution and making it \nclear to her former boss, Percy (Xander \nBerkeley, &quot;24&quot;) and her former friends Michael \n(Shane West, &quot;E.R.&quot;) and Birkhoff (Aaron \nStanford, &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand) that she will \nstop at nothing to expose and destroy their \ncovert operation. Division continues to recruit \nand train other young people, among them Jaden \n(Tiffany Hines, &quot;Bones&quot;) and Thom (Ashton \nHolmes, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;), erasing all evidence \nof their former lives and turning them into cold \nand efficient killers. One of these new \nrecruits, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;) is a \nbeautiful girl with a violent past and a story \nnot so different from Nikita's. The recruits all \nspend part of their training with Amanda \n(Melinda Clarke, &quot;The O.C.&quot;), a master \nmanipulator who can turn any ugly duckling into \na swan and any bleeding heart into a killer.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08dc1241f4b5af10a9d2436a1e8cd055810e0694","amp;dn":"Nikita.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08dc1241f4b5af10a9d2436a1e8cd055810e0694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,220,18,65,244,181,175,16,169,210,67,106,30,140,208,85,129,14,6,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
