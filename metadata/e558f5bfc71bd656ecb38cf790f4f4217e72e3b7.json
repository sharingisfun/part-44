Instead, he argues, what we have in America is a nation of places not worth caring about.\n\nJames Howard Kunstler calls suburban sprawl &quot;the greatest misallocation of resources the world has ever known.&quot; His arguments bring a new lens to urban development, drawing clear connections between physical spaces and cultural vitality.\n\nGeography of Nowhere, published in 1993, presented a grim vision of America in decline -- a nation of cookie-cutter strip malls, vacuous city centers, and dead spaces wrought by what Kunstler calls the ethos of Happy Motoring: our society-wide dependence on the automobile.\n\nThe Long Emergency (2005) takes a hard look at energy dependency, arguing that the end of the fossil fuels era will force a return to smaller-scale, agrarian-focused communities and an overhaul of many of the most prominent and destructive features of postwar society.\n\nHis confrontational approach and propensity for doomsday scenarios make Kunstler a lightning rod for controversy and critics. But his magnificent rants are underscored with logic and his books are widely read, particularly by architectural critics and urban planners.\n\n    &quot;The upside of Kunstler's anger is that he's getting people to sit up and take notice.&quot;\n\nOutside magazine\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
