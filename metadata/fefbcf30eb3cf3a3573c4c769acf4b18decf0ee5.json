The music on this disc is slightly more straightforward than conventional western swing, yet it should appeal to fans of Duncan's classic recordings with Bob Wills, even with the slightly inconsistent musical quality. Nevertheless, Beneath a Neon Star in a Honky Tonk and its companion volume Texas Moon, are necessary for hardcore collectors of western swing in general and Duncan in particular. ~ Thom Owens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefbcf30eb3cf3a3573c4c769acf4b18decf0ee5","amp;dn":"Tommy+Duncan+-+Beneath+A+Neon+Star+In+A+Honky+Tonk+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefbcf30eb3cf3a3573c4c769acf4b18decf0ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,251,207,48,235,60,243,163,87,60,76,118,154,207,75,24,222,207,14,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
