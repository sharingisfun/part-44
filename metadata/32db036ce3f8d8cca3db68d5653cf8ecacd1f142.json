His television series The Modest Adventures of David O'Doherty was broadcast on RTÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â° Television in 2007.

His nephew, Conor, consistently beats him at pitch and putt. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jzfexzw5ldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jzfexzw5ldje&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O%27Doherty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O%27Doherty&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32db036ce3f8d8cca3db68d5653cf8ecacd1f142","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+David+O%5C%27Doherty+-++Giggle+Me+Timbers+%28Jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32db036ce3f8d8cca3db68d5653cf8ecacd1f142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,219,3,108,227,248,216,204,163,219,104,213,101,60,248,236,172,209,241,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
