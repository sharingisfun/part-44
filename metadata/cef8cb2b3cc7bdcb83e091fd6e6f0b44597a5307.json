They wear T-shirts with strange logos, speak a language incomprehensible to mere mortals, feed mainly on that which can be ordered online, and would rather spend an evening upgrading their computers than going out with friends... Fred is a Geek and, all things considered, his life is pretty great. This special was compiled using gags from several volumes of Thomas Labourot's 'Les Geeks'.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adg0kkTf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adg0kkTf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adm2hp7T.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adm2hp7T.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acr27Kvu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acr27Kvu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abcRdpi5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abcRdpi5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef8cb2b3cc7bdcb83e091fd6e6f0b44597a5307","amp;dn":"Geeks+-+Lingeekstics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef8cb2b3cc7bdcb83e091fd6e6f0b44597a5307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,248,203,43,60,199,189,203,131,224,145,253,110,111,11,68,89,122,83,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
