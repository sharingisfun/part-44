Or, rather, diets,since the book details three very different main approaches to controlling carbohydrates (including the Basic Low Carb Diet, similar to Atkins or Protein Power, and the Mini-Binge Diet, popularized as The Carbohydrate AddictÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diet), plus several variations, finally summing up the basic principles which tie them all together. The point is to give the reader the tools necessary to construct a new way of eating that will fit his or her body, psyche, and lifestyle, thus allowing them to stay slim, energetic, and healthy for life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80aa05fe64a0f9b559e112b60664ae9e4cf317a1","amp;dn":"How_I_Gave_Up_My_Low-Fat_Diet_and_Lost_40_Pounds+OCR.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80aa05fe64a0f9b559e112b60664ae9e4cf317a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,170,5,254,100,160,249,181,89,225,18,182,6,100,174,158,76,243,23,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
