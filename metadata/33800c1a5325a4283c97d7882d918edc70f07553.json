Bassist Adrian Alperstein was added to the lineup a few months after the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original formation, and in 2010 the band completed their lineup with vocalist Ryan Devlin and guitarist Ryan Borrell. Throughout this process of finding band members, the band released several demos online which initiated the growth of their fanbase. In September of 2011, the band released their debut work titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“NostalgiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nBringing forth a truly progressive sound with a metallic edge, the balance heard in this album is sure to spark interest in both 'classic' prog-metal fans and contemporary metal fans alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33800c1a5325a4283c97d7882d918edc70f07553","amp;dn":"Corelia+-+2011+-+Nostalgia+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33800c1a5325a4283c97d7882d918edc70f07553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,128,12,26,83,37,164,40,60,151,215,136,45,145,142,220,112,240,117,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
