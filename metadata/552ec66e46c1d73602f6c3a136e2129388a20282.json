Set in the near future after an electromagnetic pulse detonated by terrorists crippled the US economy, Max, a genetically-enhanced human prototype with attitude to spare, escaped from her military creators and made a life for herself on the edgy streets of 21st-century Seattle. She becomes a reluctant hero when she teams up with idealistic, underground cyber-journalist Logan Cale, lending her unique abilities to his crusade against corruption and an oppressive establishment. Played from a zoomed-out perspective, players fight their way through 3D levels, using martial arts moves, wall jumping and plenty of throws to defeat the opposition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:552ec66e46c1d73602f6c3a136e2129388a20282","amp;dn":"James+Camerons+Dark+Angel+%5BMULTI5%5D+ps2+pal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"552ec66e46c1d73602f6c3a136e2129388a20282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,46,198,110,70,193,215,54,2,246,195,161,54,226,18,147,136,162,2,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
