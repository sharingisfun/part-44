Informative, irreverent, and entertaining, the completely revised fourth edition of Steal This Computer Book contains new chapters discussing the hacker mentality, lock picking, exploiting P2P file sharing networks, and how people manipulate search engines and pop-up ads. Includes a CD with hundreds of megabytes of hacking and security-related programs that tie-in to each chapter in the book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118c1598b9662452bd077bb66fecae223c2b677b","amp;dn":"Steal+This+Computer+Book+4.0.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118c1598b9662452bd077bb66fecae223c2b677b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,140,21,152,185,102,36,82,189,7,123,182,111,236,174,34,60,43,103,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
