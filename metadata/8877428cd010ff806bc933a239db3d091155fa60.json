This book traces the development of these new technologies, including the CSS Ã¢â‚¬ËœLittle DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHunleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - respectively the first torpedo boat and submarine to sink an enemy warship. The wreck of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHunleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was raised in 2000, and this is the first book ever to integrate details of its recovery with an account of Confederate submarines in action","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8877428cd010ff806bc933a239db3d091155fa60","amp;dn":"Confederate+Submarines+and+Torpedo+Vessels+1861-65","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8877428cd010ff806bc933a239db3d091155fa60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,119,66,140,208,16,255,128,107,201,51,162,57,219,61,9,17,85,250,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
