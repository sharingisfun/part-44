Four tales across history are told in dizzying and masterly alternation, all linked by the broad themes of intolerance and hatred. The poignant, the brutal, the hair-raising and the sentimental churn together in meticulously composed spectacles.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nic Rapold, The New York Times\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The way Griffith brings all four stories to a climax at the same time so that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re chasing along in a chariot, the cross is being carried through Jerusalem, the Huguenots are being slaughtered and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tearing along in a train across modern America, is just amazing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kevin Brownlow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2ec44061716939035a3cf70fad80ef41c9a4a2","amp;dn":"INTOLERANCE.1916.BRRip.new.soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2ec44061716939035a3cf70fad80ef41c9a4a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,46,196,64,97,113,105,57,3,90,60,247,15,173,128,239,65,201,164,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
