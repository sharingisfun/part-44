Vice City is a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, and is the most varied and complete digital city ever created. Combining nonlinear gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with seedy opportunities and are given the chance to take it over as you choose. Take control of a variety of vehicles including high-performance cars and motorbikes, powerboats, golf buggies and helicopters. Browse through the radio stations, with styles ranging from rock to electro to find a sultry melody or pumping beat to suit your mood. No matter what type of man you are, Vice City is always full of surprises.\n\nRelease: May 12, 2003 On PlayStation 2 Xbox &amp; PC\n\n\nPlease Seed &amp; Comment Torrent By LilReaper22395","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ee9df0ac6156190368bedf30e77a78d666664e","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+Vice+City+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ee9df0ac6156190368bedf30e77a78d666664e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,238,157,240,172,97,86,25,3,104,190,223,48,231,122,120,214,102,102,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
