A great miniature Alien Breed clone. Several episodes of alien extermination in a line-of-sight setting (watch out of they'll get you!) and multiple weaponry.\n\nThis is the original indie version before it went through a publisher that didn't do anything good to it.\n\nYou'll need RAR to extract and DOSBOX or a real DOS environment to run. I won't helpdesk for anyone.\n\nThe game is nowadays somewhat hard to get hold of, so here you go. It's been anonymized and tested to work by our Collective. Enjoy. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2baf5ab550af300e12649c3694d9543b025397ae","amp;dn":"Threat+by+Fragment+DOS+game+full+registered+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2baf5ab550af300e12649c3694d9543b025397ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,175,90,181,80,175,48,14,18,100,156,54,148,217,84,59,2,83,151,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
