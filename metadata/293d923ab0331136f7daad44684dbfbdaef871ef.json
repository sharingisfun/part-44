Lone Racer is the story of a down-and-out racecar driver whose days of success are long gone. After a misguided attempt at a bank robbery - where he is supposed to drive the getaway car - Lone Racer decides that his days of going downhill are over. Will he get back on track? A rare blend of whimsy and sadness, Lone Racer is a story of fast cars, faster women, and one man's ride from first to worst and back again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:293d923ab0331136f7daad44684dbfbdaef871ef","amp;dn":"Nicolas+Mahler+-+Lone+Racer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"293d923ab0331136f7daad44684dbfbdaef871ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,61,146,58,176,51,17,54,247,218,173,68,104,77,191,189,174,248,113,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
