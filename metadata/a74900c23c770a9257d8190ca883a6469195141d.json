He is unwelcome in the town and his only friend appears to be his duck. Playing outside on the ice one day, Peter&amp;#039;s grandfather takes and locks him in the house ? leaving the duck unprotected when a wolf comes. Witnessing the death of his friend in the jaws of the wolf, Peter sets out to get instant revenge with a deadly and dangerous plan.\n\nIn this updating of the famous story, we find ourselves in a modern (yet also ancient) setting that feels like it is Eastern Europe. The story is well delivered and is a good mix of issues regarding the young boy Peter and the variety of emotions he goes through across the film. Although it is short it is engaging and interesting and I found all of it to be easy to watch and enjoyable. The plot is easy to follow but will provide food for thought for older pre-teens. Animation wise the film looks great. Some viewers will bemoan the washed out and depressed look of the film but for me this was a strength as it allows the touching moments of happiness to stand out more but more importantly gives the whole thing a nice edge that I thought worked and drew me in.\n\nImage;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/?x=my6&amp;myref=http://my.imageshack.us/v_images.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/?x=my6&amp;myref=http://my.imageshack.us/v_images.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74900c23c770a9257d8190ca883a6469195141d","amp;dn":"Prokofiev+Peter+and+the+Wolf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74900c23c770a9257d8190ca883a6469195141d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,73,0,194,60,119,10,146,87,216,25,12,168,131,166,70,145,149,20,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
