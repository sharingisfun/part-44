If one weren't in the same room with him. If one was in the same room with him, one simply called him Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sir.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Six feet, seven inches tall, he weighed in at nearly three hundred pounds. One hundred percent of him muscle-laden, proud-as-fuck United States of goddamned American bad ass Marine. The very last thing anyone wanted to do was to piss him off. \n\nHarassing his woman was a damned good way to piss him off. It didn't matter that she wasn't really his woman, it was implied. Fortunately, that was an oversight he was about to fix. But convincing the plus sized, ebony beauty she was the one for him might prove to be his most important mission to date.\n\n\n\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bba0da132741f4892ccc70e67301d5f02ebceeb6","amp;dn":"Marteeka+Karland+-+Chunky+But+Funky+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bba0da132741f4892ccc70e67301d5f02ebceeb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,160,218,19,39,65,244,137,44,204,112,230,115,1,213,240,46,188,238,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
