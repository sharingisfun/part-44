Here they are, TPB style.\n\nTo install, drag the M4R files into the LIBRARY section of your iTunes window, then make sure your iPhone is set to sync all ringtones (accessible from the RINGTONES section of your iPhone status in iTunes while your iPhone is plugged into your computer).\n\n\n\nZen Collection\n\n\niRingPro's stunning new line of professional iPhone ringtones.\n\nSubtle. Elegant. Sophisticated. With the Zen Collection of professional iPhone ringtones, iRingPro has established a new level of sophistication and etiquette in phone call reporting. You own the best phone money can buy, we believe it should sound like it.\n\n \nThese aren't ring &quot;tunes&quot;.\n\nThese aren't some 11-year-olds' ringtones. You'll find no annoying songs, or silly sound effects. The Zen Collection consists of smart, attractive, livable alerts engineered to ensure universal appeal, and provide a high tolerance for routine use and repetition.\n\n\nI heard you the first time.\n\niRingPro iPhone Ringtones are timed with moderately longer pauses between ring repeats. So there is no hurried fumbling, no urgency. You have time to see who's calling, often before the second ring. You're in control, not your phone.\n\n\nYou are what you ring.\n\nA phone's ring broadcasts many things about its user. iRingPro iPhone Ringtones ensure that what is perceived when your phone rings is technically advanced, considerate, and envyingly fashionable. Now, more than ever, a professional presence can make the difference.\n\n\nRinger Grades\n\nThe Zen Collection gives you the ability to fine tune your phone's report. Each of the collection's 21 iPhone ringtones falls into one of two categories:\n\nMeeting Grade\n\nThe tonal quality of iRingPro's Meeting Grade ringtones are subtler, lower pitched, and richer. These ringtones were designed specifically for quiet or professional settings. Though alertive, conversation can continue undisturbed. These can be identified by the file tag &quot;MG&quot;.\n\nActive Grade\n\nOur Active Grade ringtones are stronger, more resonant, and present. They have been engineered to maximize your iPhone's &quot;small-speaker&quot; technology, and will be more audible in cars, social and outdoor settings. These can be identified by the file tag &quot;AG&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641b01b1a76dc6794edb887e80bb095617b3a0c6","amp;dn":"iRingPro+Zen+Collection+-+Professional+iPhone+Ringtones+%28M4R%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641b01b1a76dc6794edb887e80bb095617b3a0c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,27,1,177,167,109,198,121,78,219,136,126,128,187,9,86,23,179,160,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
