It tells the story of the two major space powers starting out on their very separate programs, but slowly coming together. It describes rarely mentioned development programs, most of which never flew, including the US Manned Orbiting Laboratory, the Soviet Almaz station, and the Soviet Polyus battlestation. The Mir space station was one of the greatest human achievements in modern history, and a thorough telling of its story is essential to this book. This book is the first of its kind to tell the whole story of the manned space stations from the USA and Russia.\n\n2007\nPDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af401fcf8d825489ebf2cfb523ea0bdae0f058b7","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Manned+Space+Stations+-+An+Introduction.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af401fcf8d825489ebf2cfb523ea0bdae0f058b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,64,31,207,141,130,84,137,235,242,207,181,35,234,11,218,224,240,88,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
