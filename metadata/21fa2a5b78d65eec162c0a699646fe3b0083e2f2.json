Roy Fehler is full of ideals. And Serge Duran is an ex-marine running away from his Chicano childhood. In a few weeks they'll put on the blue uniform of the LAPD. In months they'll know how to interpret the mad babble of the car radio, smell danger, trap a drug dealer, hide a secret, and-most of all-live with the understanding that cops are different from everyone else. But for these men, these new centurions, time is an enemy. The year is 1960. The streets are burning with rage. And before they can grow old on this job, they'll have to fight for their lives...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21fa2a5b78d65eec162c0a699646fe3b0083e2f2","amp;dn":"The+New+Centurions+by+Joseph+Wambaugh+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21fa2a5b78d65eec162c0a699646fe3b0083e2f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,250,42,91,120,214,94,236,22,44,10,105,150,70,254,59,0,131,226,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
