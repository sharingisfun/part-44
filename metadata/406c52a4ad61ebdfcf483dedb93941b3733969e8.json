Throsby's third full-length album, A Loud Call, reflects a philosophy similar to her vocal style; the approach is subtle and quiet, but beneath it all is a clear sense of musical direction and a sound that's not so much simple as elegant. The clean, uncluttered arrangements and recording also suit Throsby's songs, which tell their stories through the accumulated weight of small details and acute observations, and on &quot;Would You&quot; (a duet with Will Oldham), she's able to sum up the push and pull between longing, desire, and anxiety with just four lines that circle one another with the grace of a pair of ballroom dancers. A Loud Call is a touch more polished than Throsby's 2006 debut, but ultimately this album puts the singer and her songs front and center, and despite lovely performances from a fine ensemble (including members of Lambchop and the Silver Jews), she commands the spotlight from the first song to the last. Holly Throsby's music is perhaps too delicate and refined a taste to appeal to the same sort of audience as her fellow Australian Kasey Chambers, but if you're willing to acquire a taste for Throsby's work, you'll find A Loud Call to be a rare and satisfying treat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406c52a4ad61ebdfcf483dedb93941b3733969e8","amp;dn":"Holly+Throsby+-+A+Loud+Call+%5B2008%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406c52a4ad61ebdfcf483dedb93941b3733969e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,108,82,164,173,97,235,223,207,72,61,237,185,57,65,179,115,57,105,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
