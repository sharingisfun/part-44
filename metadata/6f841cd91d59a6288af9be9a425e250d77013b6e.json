The fact of the matter is that one needs only to feel the Suns rays in order to experience the presence of a star. The Sun is an ordinary star, a ball of hot gas much like millions of others in the universe, but as the center of the solar system, it is critical to the survival of all life forms on Earth. This comprehensive volume examines the nature of the Sun and details the properties and types of various stars, as well as the greater galaxies of which they are a part.\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroductIon 6\nchapter 1 the Sun: the center of the Solar System 10\nchapter 2 Structure and energy production of the Sun 22\nchapter 3 the SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s magnetIc fields and Solar activity 35\nchapter 4 the Stars: their place In the Sky 43\nchapter 5 the properties of Stars 59\nchapter 6 the lives of Stars 68\nchapter 7 galaxies 76\nconcluSIon 86\nglossary 88\nFor more InformatIon 90\nBibliography 93\nIndex 94 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f841cd91d59a6288af9be9a425e250d77013b6e","amp;dn":"The+Sun%2C+Stars%2C+And+Galaxies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f841cd91d59a6288af9be9a425e250d77013b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,132,28,217,29,89,166,40,138,249,190,154,66,94,37,13,119,1,59,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
