(I also have a lot of other K.Flay stuff in other torrents.)\n\nReupload of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6038687 - that was stuck at 98.5% because some pieces of the files had changed. The files didn't play as is, but I was able to load them into Audacity and re-export them.\n\nThe originals were 160kbps CBR. These are VBR equivalent to that. I removed silent fade-ins/fade-outs in some tracks, so the runtime of those is a bit shorter, but I left the audio otherwise unchanged. Is Anybody Listening.mp3 was renamed to Is There Anybody Listening.mp3 (the title tag was already accurate)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebbd4d8ac8221e19f4df4e9d3ae06e1a30e5e8a4","amp;dn":"K.Flay+Assortment+%28Other+Material%29+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebbd4d8ac8221e19f4df4e9d3ae06e1a30e5e8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,189,77,138,200,34,30,25,244,223,78,157,58,224,110,26,48,229,232,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
