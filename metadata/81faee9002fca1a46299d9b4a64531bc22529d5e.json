It's quite a nice series, and it's a shame that it was never translated to another language than Dutch or French. This pilot even was never published as a comic book, it was only published in Journal de Spirou in 1982. I'm sorry to say that I did not have all the pages in French available, so most of them were translated from the Dutch version. This is my very first own scanning/cleaning job, so please comment on how well it went!\n\nThere's also a television series loosely based on this comic, but more light and for a younger audience. I hope fans of that television series (which was translated into English) enjoy this fan translation of the pilot, which I aptly named &quot;Billy the cat: The Pilot&quot;, and ask for more, or that a new audience is intrigued by this comic.\n\nI would also like corrections on my grammar and spelling, and general word usage.\nIf my sentences are weird, please correct me, then I'll upload a new version with the corrections included.\n\nWhen an official release is released, this torrent will probably be deleted. You have been warned.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use *.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other translated Belgian/French comics, you can check my release thread: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced. You can also indicate which series you rather want to read more of. Just comment on a torrent, rate the torrent or send me a message/PM on suprbay, and you'll be able to read it in about one month!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81faee9002fca1a46299d9b4a64531bc22529d5e","amp;dn":"Billy_the_cat_T00-pilotepisode.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81faee9002fca1a46299d9b4a64531bc22529d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,250,238,144,2,252,161,164,98,153,217,180,166,69,49,188,34,82,157,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
