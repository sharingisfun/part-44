So what does spear-hunting reveal about how chimpanzees think? Dr Savage-Rumbaugh, of the Great Ape Trust, in Des Moines, Iowa, adds: \n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœKanzi makes fire because he wants to. He used to watch the film Quest For Fire when he was very young which was about early man struggling to control fire. He watched it spellbound over and over hundreds of times. He was fascinated by the camp fires his keepers made to cook food.\n\nAt the age of five, he was making small piles of bone dry sticks.\n\nHe was taught to use matches, a skill he picked up quickly.\n\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something eerie about watching Kanzi strike a match.\n\nThe way he holds the flame - taking care not to burn himself - is remarkably human.\n\nThe tool-making was an exercise devised by Eviatar Nevo, of the University of Haifa.\n\nIn conversation with the researchers Kanzi points to symbols, known as lexigrams, on the keyboards representing different words. He has learned to Ã¢â‚¬ËœsayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ around 500 words through the keyboard, and understands 3,000 spoken words.\n\nKanzi had trouble learning how to properly use a lighter, but he knows now!\n\nThe owner better not let the chimp watch Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlanet of the ApesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢!\n\nAnd this would be good to gift someone special.\n\nCover:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/bj9ry6zq/d135a38c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/bj9ry6zq/d135a38c&lt;/a&gt;\n\n (seeds please)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de831e13f08fe63f1de5558aabc5464aaf9a8e83","amp;dn":"APE+GENiUS+%28DVD5%2C+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de831e13f08fe63f1de5558aabc5464aaf9a8e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,131,30,19,240,143,230,63,29,229,85,138,171,197,70,74,175,154,142,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
