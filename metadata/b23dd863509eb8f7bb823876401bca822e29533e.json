After his brother abdicates, George ('Bertie') reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be king, Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, Bertie is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war.\n\n\nREVIEW: (IMDB)\n\nNo spoilers here. I would like to let everyone know that this is an excellent film. I enjoyed it this week at the Mill Valley Film Festival in Marin County, CA. Given the outstanding cast and director, and my fascination with historical figures, I had high hopes for this film, though mixed with a certain resignation that I might be disappointed. There was no way I could have imagined how wonderful &quot;The King's Speech&quot; would be. There was abundant humor without the film ever becoming a comedy, drama without dreariness, and many deeply moving moments. I can't praise this film enough. It boosted my appreciation of the human capacity to become our best selves, and rise to meet even the most daunting challenges.\n\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4359/d5oqiebvjq5vhum0rhm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4359/d5oqiebvjq5vhum0rhm.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2506/zae9k5zeng3oghdzwegg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2506/zae9k5zeng3oghdzwegg.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/9990/m9zdrsyvrewvehx8xo2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/9990/m9zdrsyvrewvehx8xo2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!
