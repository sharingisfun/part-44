She shared a unique and mystical vision of Christianity and Catholic teachings through her writing. In 1944, The Reed of God, a collection of profound and lyrical essays about Mary, established Houselander as a respected modern spiritual writer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bd018b4196e8021ffabe0269c35d14eb22ce718","amp;dn":"Caryll+Houselander+-+3+books+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bd018b4196e8021ffabe0269c35d14eb22ce718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,208,24,180,25,110,128,33,255,171,224,38,156,53,209,78,178,44,231,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
