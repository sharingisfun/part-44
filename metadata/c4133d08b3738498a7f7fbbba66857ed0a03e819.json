Drag an app into your applications folder, and it's installed. You'd think it would be that easy to delete an app ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ just a matter of dragging it to the trash. But it's not. Applications install preferences, caches, and other support files throughout your computer that take up space and generate clutter. Deleting these by hand every time you delete an app is a pain.\n\n\nIntroducing AppZapper. AppZapper is for people who want to confidently try new apps while knowing they can uninstall them easily. Drag one or more unwanted apps onto AppZapper and watch as it finds all the extra files and lets you delete them with a single click. A slick safety system remembers which apps you want to keep safe, and the log tracks all the files you've zapped. In one Zap you'll understand it. In two you'll fall in love. Within the five free Zaps, you'll know you need to add AppZapper to your arsenal.\n\nVersion 1.8.0\n\nFREE UPDATES FOR LIFE WITH THIS SERIAL ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4133d08b3738498a7f7fbbba66857ed0a03e819","amp;dn":"Appzapper+1.8.0%2Bsn.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4133d08b3738498a7f7fbbba66857ed0a03e819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,19,61,8,179,115,132,152,167,247,251,187,166,104,87,237,10,3,232,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
