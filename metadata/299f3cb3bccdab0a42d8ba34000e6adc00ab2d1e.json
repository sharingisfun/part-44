A martial artist who's too nearsighted to recognize whom he's attacking, Issei plays Ryoga to Sousuke's Ranma. When the school president makes them care for the janitor they inadvertently punched out, they nearly destroy the school in a bout of competitive nurturing. Sousuke infiltrates an amusement park by disguising himself as Bonta-kun, a mascot reminiscent of Hamtaro in the hilarious &quot;Single-Minded Stakeout.&quot; The comic violence makes a wonderful foil for the character's aggressive cuteness. (Sousuke later outfits the plush suit with a helmet and flak jacket.) During lulls in the insanity, Kaname and Sousuke grudgingly admit to liking each other, but it's obvious that the course of their true love will never run smoothly. (Rated TV PG V: comic violence, minor risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© humor, alcohol and tobacco use) --Charles Solomon \n\nSousukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in for the fight of his life! A simple art assignment turns deadly as the entire class gangs up on the mercenary-turned-model. Then, he has to defend Kaname against Yakuza thugs, battle karate masters, escape a chainsaw-wielding janitor, and rein in a super-creepy stalker. And just when you thought it couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get crazier, Kaname and Sousuke head to a haunted hospital, where blood-spattered ghosts teach the pair a frightening lesson in deception. The combat and comedy never let up in the second volume of Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! Hold onto your seats (and your sides), because this disc packs a full metal punch! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:299f3cb3bccdab0a42d8ba34000e6adc00ab2d1e","amp;dn":"FULL+METAL+PANIC+FUMOFFU+VOL+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"299f3cb3bccdab0a42d8ba34000e6adc00ab2d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,159,60,179,188,205,171,10,66,216,186,52,0,14,106,220,0,171,45,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
