That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\n=================================\n\nAbout 317GB to go after this one!\n\nThe theme of the day is &quot;nitpicking&quot;(or &quot;nitpik'n) &quot; or &quot;education&quot; !

This biggest need here is for someone to crop the huge margins. Volunteers? It's easy, just tedious. Other edits might be nice but much more time required for that.  if you do it I'll put them in a fill torrent. BTW there will probably be just two fill torrents and I am thinking I will hold them till the end, or do one very soon and one at the end.\n\nPalette of 12 Secret Colors, The v1-5 (CMX-Raw Scans\n\n     This is not actually one of the DC published humanoids titles, and it's not related to one so far as I know.

Archie and crew became so popular that they eventually took over the company almost entirely. \n     But they have published as Red Circle Comics, Radio Comics, and MLJ Comics.

If you have never seen the animated comedy &quot;South Park&quot; episode that introduced him to an unsuspecting world, I'm not going to explain it except to say he was against harassment, not a harasser. Panda's are way too nice (in our imagination) to do such a thing. Real Pandas can be dangerous of course, but not in that way. Except perhaps to other pandas. Lacking any legal system, female Pandas have little recourse, so they mostly keep quite about it. Male Pandas will never admit to being victims.\n\n     BTW, if your are old enough you will recall being taught in school, by TV wildlife documentaries, byeager Zoo docents, etc that Panda's were absolutely NOT bears as widely thought and don't you dare call then &quot;Panda Bears&quot;. Now of course they un-apologetically let us know that they are, after all, bears. Where that leaves them in relation to their erstwhile relatives the &quot;Red Panda&quot; which as far as I know are not at all closely related to bears, is a story for another time. Look for Red Pandas to get a new name as it would appear &quot;Panda&quot; is now a misnomer.\n\n     BTW, since we are on the subject of classifications, let me educate you about one of my pet peeves. Monkeys have tails. Apes do not have tails (I don't know if apes taught sign language ever have tales - see what I did there?). Don't let me catch you at the zoo or in the forest referring to anything without a tail as a monkey.  I restrain my self from correcting children and parents at the zoo when they call Gorillas, Chimps. Bonobos, Orangs, Gibbons and Siamangs Monkeys. I make an exception for calling human children &quot;little monkeys&quot; since it's metaphorical.\n\n     BTW, you might think the above is a natural mistake, but what about parents who don't know the difference between a LIon, a Leopard and a Tiger?\n\n     BTW, That's a lot of BTWs and this is a lot from &quot;Peter Panda, and yet there's more!\n\n     In quite the opposite vein, or so you may think, I maintain it is perfectly ok to speak of &quot;Shellfish, Starfish&quot; etc, reasoning  along the same lines as most people who will call a tomato a vegetable, not a fruit. There are correct scientific classifications, and there is common usage -  often centered around different classifications schemes which are no less valid than the scientific ones, they just have different purposes.. There are excellent cooking and dietary reasons for calling a tomato a vegetable in those realms,. When in the realm of botany, it's a fruit. There is even a US supreme court decision affirming it as scientifically a fruit but commonly and for the purpose of some tax or tariff or the like, a vegetable. The court referred to common meal/cooking usage in it's decision. Lord god in Heaven, why do I know things like that?\n     OK so for a very long time, before the scientific classification scheme took hold (shout-out to Linnaeus!), fish meant any animal in the sea. I stand by the long time historical usage for many things  in common speech, because I think most people are well aware that clams and crabs and starfish are not fish int the scientific sense. On the other hand don't be calling a dolphin a fish.  When people do that I think it's because they really don't know the difference. \n     It's not imprecision in language that  bugs me, it's ignorance of stuff that I don't understand how it's possible not to know if you went to school. I blame people for not paying attention and learning. How could they not care? How could they not want to know EVERYTHING as I do? (i.e I want to know everything, not that I do know everything - I just act like I do.) I never blame anyone for not knowing things they had no way of knowing - but I still want to teach them because I assume they are eager to learn. Sadly, they mostly are not.\n\nPeter Panda 01-31 (1953-1958)\n\n     Peter Porkchops is a Pig, Since he is a humanized, talking pig. I think it's a bit creepy to name him after a favorite edible part of the common pig. Even if, as the beast in the book &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; he is a talking creature who actually wants to be eaten, created for just that purpose. If you don't think a being wanting and asking to be eaten is a bit disturbing and somehow wrong, or even if you do, you should read about the people who want exactly that. Famously, a German man advertised on the internet for someone to eat, and got a willing victim. He was tried for manslaughter.  There are other known cases, and it is unknown how many unknown numbers of people want to be eaten by unknown numbers of people  who want to eat them (and remain unknown). \n\nPeter Porkchops 01-62 (1949-1960)\n\nPhantom Guard 00-06 (Image-WS(1997-1998)\n\nPhantom Lady\n     Golden Age Greats v2 Phantom Lady (Paragon\n     Great Action Comics 009-reprints Phantom Lady 023 (1958)\n     Phantom Lady 001-3p (R) (Paragon(1972))\n     Phantom Lady 01-05 (Ajax-Farrell(1954-1955\n     Phantom Lady 13-23 (Fox(1947-1949)\n     Phantom Lady Archives v1-The Complete War Years (Quality 1941-1943)\n\n     AC comics published some new Phantom Lady stories thinking the character was in the public domain, but it was not.

EC stood for educational comics, and i the early days they published some in theta vein. This series was created by William Gaines, founder of EC, but partly published under the DC name. Inside the comics you will see it stated they are published by Gaines. A later connect is that EC's Mad Magazine after many years came to be published by DC. Thats' why that whole magazine is in this series.\n\nPicture Stories From The Bible\n     Picture Stories From The Bible Complete Life of Christ Edition (TPB)-unscanned.jpg\n     Picture Stories From The Bible Complete Old Testament Edition (TPB)-unscanned.jpg\n     Picture Stories from the Bible-New Testament 01-03 (DC-EC(1944-1946)\n     Picture Stories from the Bible-Old Testament 01-04 (1942-1943)\n     Picture Stories from the Bible-Old Testament HC\n\n     No CMX issues of this were to be found.
