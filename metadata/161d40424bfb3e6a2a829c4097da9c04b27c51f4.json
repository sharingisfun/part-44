These four dubplates of fire will ignite any dancefloor or schoolyard. As has been proved by the lucky sods who have had them for the past few months -(Dillon Francis, Flux Pavilion, Cookie Monsta and SKisM are just a handful of such sods.) Including the Internet sensation 'Like a Boss', this is the coming of age release for the 18 year old... wait...18 f*cking years old!? Yes, while most of us were furiously chasing girls and eating sweets at this tender age, Michael Bella is setting himself up for Dubstep super stardom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161d40424bfb3e6a2a829c4097da9c04b27c51f4","amp;dn":"Eptic-Like_A_Boss_EP-NSDX020-WEB-2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161d40424bfb3e6a2a829c4097da9c04b27c51f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,29,64,66,75,251,62,106,42,130,156,64,151,218,156,4,178,124,81,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
