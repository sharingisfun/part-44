Well youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gonna get sick of it, because this freak of nature right here is just beginning to swell, and when I get big enough, brother, there ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gonna be room for anybody else but me and all the Warriors floatinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ through the veins and the power of the Warrioooooorrrrrrr!!!&quot;\n\nFor more information on this...whatever this is, please check out the wikilink here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Warrior#Writing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Warrior#Writing&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor the amazing and hilarious Spoony and Linkara review of Warrior #1, please click here (you can also find reviews of issues 2-4 on Spoony's site): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://spoonyexperiment.com/comics/atop-the-fourth-wall-warrior-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://spoonyexperiment.com/comics/atop-the-fourth-wall-warrior-1/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHere is the definition of &quot;destrucity&quot;, a bullshit nonsense word that Warrior made up and goes into some detail explaining in the first issue (to no apparent purpose or effect): http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=destrucity\n\nOkay, so James Brian Hellwig - now legally known as Warrior - is utterly, abjectly insane. He was more or less a deranged madman as a wrestler and these comics back that feeling up pretty clearly. This shit is almost inarguably some of the most unreadable and incomprehensible crap you could ever attempt to read. Why am I torrenting it then? Well, it was a request from KAT (let it never be said that I won't fill ANY request if I can) and also, for the curiosity factor in case you are reading this and wonder, &quot;are they really THAT bad?&quot;\n\nYes, yes they are. Watch the review video. Get your goggles on. Hide your children and empty your stomach. It is really THAT BAD.\n\nAgain, just to be clear, these comics were written by THIS man:\n\nAnywho, with that warning out of the way, if you have in fact accepted Satan as your lord and master or have no regard for your own sanity, this torrent contains all 4 terrible issues of Warrior, as well as the terrible Ashcan edition, the horrifying X-Mas Special (which implies that Warrior rapes Santa - and no, I'm NOT KIDDING) and Ultimate Warrior Workout, so you too can be a cocaine and steroid-fueled muscle bound weirdo. Oh wait, it neglects to mention that part of the training...wonder why?\n\nThere are no scanning credits and frankly, if I had scanned this turd I wouldn't want my name on it either. &quot;Thanks&quot; (?) to them for their anonymous efforts, and please seed and,...enjoy (?)\n\nIf you can read this unironically and like it, then you deserve a freaking medal. And a mental examination. Again, THIS MAN wrote THIS COMIC:\n\nOkay? Okay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c54ecbbfdb53bb6c875237807d52694ab3495a1","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Warrior+Destrucity+Collection+%281991-1997%29+%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c54ecbbfdb53bb6c875237807d52694ab3495a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,84,236,187,253,181,59,182,200,117,35,120,7,213,38,148,171,52,149,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
