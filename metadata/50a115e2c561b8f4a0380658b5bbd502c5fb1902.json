ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in the works since at least 2011, when Sam Phillips told American Songwriter Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sweet kind of album and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where it came from. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what compelled me to make it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably a bad idea, but everytime I listen to what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done, it makes me really happy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And so with the listener. Several of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 10 songs are jubilant, toe-tapping vintage pop numbers. But none of them are overly so, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what makes the album interesting.\n\nTake Ã¢â‚¬Å“When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m AloneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for instance. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nice, upbeat country shuffle. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alone now, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not lonely,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Phillips sings, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be alone in this world than to be lonely together like weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a breakup (or divorce) song; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m finally over youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ song. So while it communicates satisfaction, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a satisfaction chastened by loss. This is even more the case in Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Over Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ where she muses, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like walking in the starlight in the daytime/ Where your insides are brighter than the light/ Drained of emptiness that filled me/ The dark is gone; IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not holding onto anything.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs a whole, Push Any Button seems like an album about coming out of a long, hard period of despair. And while this is explicit in the lyrics, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even more apparent in the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliantly understated production. Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Over Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for instance, balances a slightly off-kilter acoustic guitar riff with Motown-style horn lines played only in low brass. While the melody might more obviously lend itself to brighter colors and richer textures Ã¢â‚¬â€ trumpets and saxophones, organ, electric guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€ the track instead breathes with intentionally empty space. And this only makes sense; a newfound sense of clarity does warrant exaltation, but not excessive exaltation, because that clarity has been hard-won.\n\nThis is the case throughout the album. The production is usually less interesting for what it includes than for what it leaves out. A steady hi-hat is often absent, replaced by subtle shakers and tambourines. Electric instruments, when present, usually provide texture or simple melody, not show-stealing solos. The songs are uncluttered, the parts are always distinct, and the result is almost always pleasing.\n\nIf the record has a weakness, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that none of the songs are particularly memorable (which is not to say they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t catchy). This may sound like harsh criticism, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean it to be taken as such. I only want to suggest that the album works best as a cohesive whole rather than as a collection of individualized songs. It takes you on a wonderful emotional arc, from the upbeat Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pretty Time BombÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the lush and mysterious Ã¢â‚¬Å“See You In DreamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the reflective Ã¢â‚¬Å“CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t See Straight.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You never feel the urge to skip to the next track, and even if the songwriting feels like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not PhillipsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best, the production is enough to keep you hooked all the way through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a115e2c561b8f4a0380658b5bbd502c5fb1902","amp;dn":"Sam+Phillips+-+Push+Any+Button+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a115e2c561b8f4a0380658b5bbd502c5fb1902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,161,21,226,197,97,184,244,160,56,6,88,181,187,213,2,197,251,25,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
