We are surrounded by laws that govern everything - determining the colour of the stars, the gravity controlling our solar system and the beginning and end of the universe itself.\n\n\n\n7)  Asteroids - Worlds that Never Were \nAsteroids have a bad reputation as deadly rocks from space. They wiped out the dinosaurs and will be back for us. But that's only half the story. Ancient asteroids built the Earth. And they may have brought life to its barren surface. Asteroids will shape our future as much as our past. They are the perfect location for deep space colonies and could be the stepping stones that eventually send humans out into the cosmos. From icy worlds with more fresh water than Earth to flying mountains of pure metal, a hundred miles wide, scientists are striving to unlock their secrets. Could these enigmatic space rocks hold the key to how life in the Universe arises and is extinguished?\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img253.imageshack.us/img253/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/43/howtheuniverseworksseri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2251kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 45mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: Parts 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://watchseries.eu/season-2/how_the_universe_works&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://watchseries.eu/season-2/how_the_universe_works&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f6b903ef41fd680c81a5a4bb9fb6484cacf655","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+How+the+Universe+Works+Series+2+7of8+Asteroids+PDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f6b903ef41fd680c81a5a4bb9fb6484cacf655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,246,185,3,239,65,253,104,12,129,165,164,187,159,182,72,76,172,246,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
